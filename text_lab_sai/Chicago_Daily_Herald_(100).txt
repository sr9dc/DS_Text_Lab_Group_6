Seven candidates for four four-year seats Bio City: Libertyville Age: 42 Occupation: Field Clinical Representative, Inspire Medical Civic involvement: Assistant T-ball coach Q&amp;A Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A. I am running for the first time, mostly due to what we have witnessed as parents of two children at Rockland Elementary. As a group we are determined to have our children back in school full time, five days a week. 
Schools in Libertyville and across the nation have been open full time since the beginning of the year. The fact that our children have missed out on so much is unacceptable in my opinion. The parents in the district were surveyed and an overwhelming majority wanted to go back to school. Yet, that had no bearing in the decisions that have been made up to this point. We are committed to working with the teachers, staff, students, and the D70 community to open the schools in a responsible and safe manner. While giving others who wish to continue to learn from home, that option as well. But, all of our children deserve full time daily instruction from their teachers. Additionally, we need to address the challenges that lie ahead with reintroduction into full time school, those that have fallen behind which test scores have indicated. We have seen a continued downward trend in the spread of COVID-19. We also now have a vaccine that is being distributed to the most vulnerable population, front line workers, health care workers, and our educators. We cannot continue to let our children suffer. The enrollment in our schools is down significantly as well which also impacts the education dollars allocated for our district and our children. As well as increases to our already high taxes and impact on the value of our homes. We specifically moved to Libertyville for the great schools and community that we frequented when trying to decide where to buy a home. I want to make a difference in helping to bring our children back to school, build upon the foundation that has educated this community for years and produced leaders of business, famous musicians, doctors, lawyers, educators, and most importantly ... good people. I'm looking forward to working with the other school board members, teachers, and community to make D70 the best school district possible. Q. How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A. I would give the current board an incomplete in regards to the pandemic. COVID-19 is very real and we need to continue to be vigilant and measured with our protocols and maintaining proper mitigation, distancing when possible, and masks when appropriate. The science and data show that children, especially our elementary and middle school children can safely and effectively get back to full time in person learning. I can sympathize with the board members when dealing with these difficult decisions, especially in the beginning of the pandemic. But, we need new leadership that will do everything possible to get our children back ASAP. These children are missing out on so much and suffering academically, emotionally, and socially. We can no longer continue to move the goal posts on reopening. Q. How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A. I strongly believe in letting parents make the best decisions possible for their children. Using data, science, input from the medical community and engineers to put in place the plan laid out by Evan, (can we reference here?) Respecting everyone's opinion and hearing them is essential to move forward with a clear plan that works for everyone in the community. I strongly believe that there is always a compromise, those advocating for further remote learning and those that prefer in person can agree that they all want what's best for their children. I'd advocate for livestreaming of classes and working with teachers to make sure that there is equitable time spent with the remote and in-person students. Q. Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A. The district did not serve the students adequately, it's apparent when other schools in Libertyville were able to hold full time in person school for the entire year. It is obviously not possible to duplicate full day instruction in the hybrid model. While we appreciate some in-person learning, 2.5 hours a day is not sufficient. We don't know and won't know the impact on our children until they are back full time. My wife and I have hired a tutor for our son as he has fallen behind in reading and math. I have heard from numerous parents at the other schools in the district and they had to do the same while watching their kids suffer academically and emotionally during this extremely trying time. Q. Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A. Did not respond. Q. What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A. I also support allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic. Again, the science and data show that sports don't show an increased the spread of COVID-19. Physical activity is extremely important for the physical and emotional well-being of our children. By having a formal plan in place to reduce the risk of transmission, including monitoring for symptoms, temperature checks at home and on site, masks for players and staff off the field, social distancing, increased facility cleaning and staggered arrival and departure times. Those that chose not to participate always have that right. But, that should not also have to impact those that want to continue. Not letting some of these kids participate in sports might significantly impact their futures. Let's not rob the kids from doing things they love when the science does not support it.

Is data science tech's ‘sexiest job'? Talent wars say so

Is data science tech's ‘sexiest job'? Talent wars say so Murray Webb had been a lackluster student more interested in sports than schoolwork while attending a small Virginia college. Then he transferred to Kennesaw State University in suburban Atlanta to pursue a master's degree in applied statistics and landed four job offers upon graduation. Webb, 33, now earns $160,000 a year targeting health care customers for hospitals and says he is approached weekly by companies and recruiters seeking data scientists. 
Webb is part of a national employment trend that has data scientists at tech companies such as Airbnb and Uber adding the words "I'm hiring" next to their LinkedIn.com profiles. "The word on the street is there's definitely a shortage of people who can do data science," said Daniel Gutierrez, managing editor of the journal insideBIGDATA in Los Angeles. "A lot of people are transitioning from other fields like economics, psychology, mathematics, because they see the field is exploding and there's money to be made." Indeed, it turns out that even in the wake of Facebook's privacy scandal and other big-data blunders, finding people who can turn social-media clicks and user-posted photos into monetizable binary code is among the biggest challenges facing U.S. industry. People with data science bona fides are among the most sought-after professionals in business, with some data science Ph. Ds commanding as much as $300,000 or more from consulting firms. "I like to say we're seeing the employment equivalent of a run on the bank, and it's because everyone's chasing the same talent at the same time," said Jennifer Priestley, a professor of statistics and data science at Kennesaw State University. Job postings for data scientists rose 75 percent from January 2015 to January 2018 at Indeed.com, while job searches for data scientist roles rose 65 percent. A growing specialty is "sentiment analysis," or finding a way to quantify how many tweets are trashing your company or praising it. A typical data scientist job pays about $119,000 at the midpoint of salaries and rises to $168,000 at the 95th percentile, according to staffing agency Robert Half Technology. Andrew Gardner, a senior machine learning manager in Atlanta at IT security firm Symantec, fields at least one "serious inquiry" weekly from recruiters trying to hire him away even as he's trying to fill roles at Symantec. To compete for talent, Gardner is offering more perks including the ability to telecommute: "You have to compete a little differently." Aspirants like Jiong Gao, who is pursuing a master's in data science and analytics at Georgia State University, are rushing to get in while the getting's good. "It's the sexiest job in the 21st century," said a grinning Gao, 25, referencing the title of a 2012 Harvard Business Review article. "For everyone who has a background in computers, statistics and mathematics, it's the hottest job." Companies are begging colleges to let them help with class projects, hoping to get a foot in the door with future data scientists. Atlanta-based Equifax Inc. was one of 11 companies doing data science and prescriptive analytics projects with Cornell University this year, with Equifax offering up voluminous data sets scrubbed of personally identifiable information. The official goal was to determine how customers prioritized paying bills, such as whether someone is more prone to paying a mortgage, car or cell phone bill first, said Chris Yasko, who heads a data science research unit at Equifax. The unstated goal was making a connection with future graduates. "Honey, we have a backlog of companies that want to bring their data into our classroom," said Priestley. "I probably have a conversation with a company every week that wants to do that." Equifax is shortening the hiring process to keep anyone from slipping away. A data science candidate interviewed on a Friday had an offer in hand by the following Monday, said Peter Maynard, senior vice president of global analytics. The company hasn't seen a drop-off in candidate interest despite suffering a data breach that exposed some 146 million people's personal information, the company said. Experts in data science describe a wild West atmosphere right now, with little agreement over how to define the field and scores of people rushing to add "scientist" to their resumes whether or not it's accurate. A common definition calls data science a meshing of statistics, math and computer science, with practitioners using the Python and R programming languages to create algorithms for things like "recommendation engines" — those programs that predict what you may want to buy next based on your recent searches. "It used to be that if you were a mathematician you became a teacher, and then you became a geologist because your knowledge helped find oil, and then you went over to Wall Street," said Jim Sterne, chairman of the Digital Analytics Association. "And now, the quote is, the best minds of our generation are being put to work in advertising."

The new Foundations of Data Science certificate program at College of DuPage prepares students for careers in data analysis fields while providing cross-training for employees who want a sought-after skills set.
Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining.
"The data scientist has been described as the sexiest job of the 21st century," said Christine Monnier, Professor of Sociology at College of DuPage. "We are awash in a world of data. We now have the power to run massive computations on computers, resulting in more information than ever before. We live in a brand new world with facts at our fingertips, and anything we do now generates data. But do we know what to do with it?"
Monnier said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. A new course, "Introduction to Data Sciences," covers the breadth of the field, while the rest of the curriculum addresses research.
"In ‘Introduction to Research Methods,' students learn that while data can be found anywhere, you must learn how to collect good data," she said. "Students learn statistics in ‘Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences,' and then they either take ‘Introduction to Anthropological Methods,' an anthropology course that focuses on fieldwork, or ‘Introduction to Behavioral Research,' a psychology course that focuses on experimental practices."
Monnier said that most existing certificates in this field are very specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on the technical aspects of data processing.
"We wanted our certificate to be accessible to a broader population," she said. "People who are interested but new to the field can pursue the Foundations of Data Science certificate, and you don't need a background in computer science. You can even take several of the courses to fulfill general education requirements.
"Data analysis skills and research are the ultimate portable skills that have a wide range of applications and are sought after in multiple fields, such as marketing, public health, criminal justice and public policy. President Barak Obama is the first ever president to appoint a U.S. Chief of Data Scientist in his administration. It's a really hot field."
College of DuPage is an accredited community college that serves more than 29,000 students each term. The College, which grants nine associate degrees and more than 170 certificates in 100 areas of study, is the second largest provider of public undergraduate education in Illinois.

Bio Hometown: Arlington Heights Age: 39 Occupation: Lawyer (in-house corporate counsel) Employer: Syntellis Performance Solutions, LLC (10 S. Wacker Dr., Suite 3375, Chicago, IL 60606) Civic involvement: Member of the CCSD 59 Board of Education since March 2020 Q&amp;A Q. Why are you running for this office? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A. I am running for the school board for two reasons. First, I want to advocate for high quality, rigorous, and equitable learning opportunities for all children. 
The children in District 59 have the right to an education that will equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate, compete, and succeed in a global society. Second, I want to advocate for families — in particular those who may feel underrepresented and/or excluded as decision-makers in their children's education. Families play a key role in the education of their children and home-school relationships are vital to supporting students' academic achievement. I was raised to value education and have personally experienced how transformative a quality education can be to a family and its future generations. I want this for all children and families in District 59. Q. How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A. I am a member of the current School Board. I know first hand that we put the safety of our students, staff, and community first. During a recent school board meeting I stated that the best we can do is rely on the data, the science, and the experts when analyzing the best way to take action. We have made difficult decisions. We are currently expanding our hybrid model so that more students can return and learn in a safe environment four days a week. I will continue to rely on the data and the guidance from the Illinois Department of Health and CDC when analyzing this issue and taking action. Q. How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A. I provided authentic, transparent leadership when making decisions regarding school closures and the pandemic. I have been very vocal throughout this process. I have clearly articulated why I am voting a certain way or why I believe the board should take certain actions. The community should understand why I am taking certain actions on the Board. I do not disregard or ignore the members who may disagree with me. I often ask questions of the administration based on comments I receive from community members who may disagree with my position. I have made every effort to be straightforward and transparent in my decisions during the pandemic. Ultimately, I represent the members of the community and take their requests and concerns seriously. Q. Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A. The District continued to provide over 450,000 meals to students during the pandemic. The District provided Wi-Fi hotspots and technology support for our students and their parents. Certain students were able to attend in person classes to receive specialized attention. However, the services we provide to address disruptions caused by the pandemic are only just beginning as we expand our return to school hybrid model. All options must be on the table to address any learning loss or negative impacts caused the pandemic. In addition, we need to ensure that we provide professional learning opportunities for staff who have also been impacted. This work must continue throughout the end of the 2021 school year, into the summer school offering, and beyond. Q. Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A. The District will follow the guidance from the Illinois Department of Health and ensure that our students and staff wear masks, maintain social distancing, wash hands, and clean their work spaces. These are the basic steps. However, the District has done more to strengthen these mitigation strategies including ventilation upgrades, specialized cleaning supplies and sprays, and plexiglass barriers for all students. We need to ensure that our students can return to a safe and comfortable learning environment this Spring. Q. What other issues need to be addressed? A. 2020 was a difficult year for our students and families. We must learn from it. We must become stronger from it. There are issues that are important to our students such as diversity, equity and inclusion efforts that must continue to be addressed and improved. Moreover, our students must have the tools to compete and succeed in a global society and this includes strengthening our curriculum. We must continue to review our processes and improve them. We should always strive to do things better. We cannot be content with where things stand.

Bio City: Carol Stream Age: 48 Occupation: Director of Operations, Sound Incorporated Civic involvement: Local volunteer, former part-time Carol Stream firefighter Q&amp;A Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state and federal authorities? A: As a board member I would listen to our residents and local business owners on what they need and the concerns they have. I would work with our other board members to address the concerns and come up with a proper game plan for everyone involved. I would stay within state and federal guidelines as long as the medical data and science backed the suggested restrictions. 
I will always lean toward the well-being of the citizens of Carol Stream as well as the livelihood of small businesses within our community. Q: Did your town continue to adequately serve its constituents during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? A: I believe Carol Stream responded to the pandemic swiftly and responsibly. The village moved all local gatherings to public Zoom meetings and they restricted access to public gathering places according to state mandates. I think the open communication with the residents was good and that the board and mayor did an outstanding job. Q: What cuts can local government make to reduce the burden of the pandemic on taxpayers? A: Carol Stream is a fiscally responsible town with a balanced budget and a board that prides itself on maintaining this moving into the future. I hope that I am able to present an outside look into future spending and maybe find more creative ways to spend but get the same result in the end. It is very important that we spend money in the proper areas so we can maintain a safe, clean, family oriented place to live. Q: What do you see as the most important infrastructure project you must address? Why and how should it be paid for? What infrastructure project can be put on the back burner? A: Luckily for Carol Stream residents most of the large infrastructure project's have been completed in previous years. Carol Stream is in beautiful shape and previous boards have made sure this continues to happen moving into the future. I think our priority should always be the safety of the residents and ensuring that we are bringing in local business's that compliment who we are as a community. Q: Do you agree or disagree with the stance your board has taken on permitting recreational marijuana sales in the community? What would you change about that stance, if you could? A: When considering this question, I think about what Carol Stream is and who we are as a community. I see us being a safe place to raise your family, a clean town with great local business and community events. I do not see marijuana sales as part of our future since I feel it would go against who we are and how residents see this village in the future. Q: What's one good idea you have to better the community that no one is talking about yet? A: Unfortunately right now is the wrong time to talk about good ideas as they tend to cost money. In order to stay safe and continue to give the residents what they expect from us as a board, we need to stay the coarse of fiscal responsibility. We need to look at new business that compliments what we are as a village and what we stand for. We need to look at more creative ways to cut spending without sacrificing the services our residents expect. Q: In light of our experiences with COVID-19, what safeguards/guidelines should you put in place to address any future public health crises? A: I hate to say that a global pandemic is a good test of a village and its response to such, but that's exactly what this was and we, as a village, responded admirably. The cooperation of residents and local businesses shows how strong of a community we have and the outpouring of community support by individuals was beyond impressive. I would hope that there are pieces that we learn from, the good, the bad, and that we work together to always be better prepared in the future. Q. Do you plan to address businesses that don't adhere to the governor's order to close or restrict business? A. The state of Illinois is bound by a Constitution and as long as those rules are followed, I will support any orders given by the Governor or the State. I believe it is very important as a local government, if rules are set forth that are unconstitutional that we stand with other local communities to let the governor and state know we are in disagreement and we will not adhere to unconstitutional mandates.

Bio Town: Barrington Age: 44 Occupation: Stay at home mom Civic involvement: Barrington Juniors Women's Club, Barrington Honor Ride and Run, Roslyn Road PTO Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election for the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I have been on the PTO of Roslyn Road for several years and I know firsthand the volunteer efforts that go into keeping our district successful. If elected, I look forward to being able to serve our entire district. 
I am running for three main reasons: I believe our children deserve the option to return to full-time in-person learning. We now know this can be done safely and the harm of keeping our children out of school far outweighs the risk of opening our schools. I believe our Board needs to focus on fiscal responsibility and transparency. Clearly articulate how our tax dollars are being spent and ensure they are allocated in ways that produce the highest returns for our children and taxpayers. I believe in holding our Board accountable to the community. The Board decisions should reflect the voice of the community. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I have been extremely disappointed in the current Board's response to the pandemic. They were never able to work together as a unit in the best interest of our children. Our community was forced to sit through meeting after meeting where little was accomplished, decisions were put off for another month, and our children suffered at home. We had a solid plan to return to school in August, once the Board decided to pull the plug on that plan at the final hour, they spent months trying to invent another option. The fact is, had they stuck with their original plan, we most likely would have had weeks of in-person learning, relationships with teachers, and a solid grasp of materials and technology before having to go remote as cases spiked in our community. Ultimately, I feel that decision set our entire district back. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: I am running to give a voice to constituents. I feel this has been an issue with our BOE for years, they send out survey after survey to solicit the opinion of the community, but decisions made continuously fail to reflect the voice of the community. The Board must have accountability to the taxpayers. The majority of parents have wanted an in-person learning option since August. Instead of moving forward with a plan in August, where 70% of parents chose a return to in-person learning and 30% chose a remote option, the Board "kicked the can" down the road for months. Our children did not return to a consistent hybrid option until January. Our youngest children have not attended a full day of school in a year. Our children a suffering from a mental health crisis and learning loss. Our "middle of the road" children are being lost in the Zoom shuffle. Our Board is exploring a remote option for the 2021/22 school year. We must focus on a safe return to full-time in-person learning for our children. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I feel our teachers did their best with an impossible situation but, were unable to adequately serve students during the pandemic. We ended up making the difficult decision to move our oldest child to St. Anne's in November, a local school that has been open full-time the entire school year. Our son was not able to successfully attend school through Zoom and his grades and mental health were suffering. We tried to work with his school and teachers to get him back on track, many teachers admitted he was not alone in his struggles, but there was only so much they could do through Zoom. We were shocked in the positive change in him after one week of in-person learning. While thankful we were able to make the move to a private school, I know this is not an option for everyone. It has motivated me to fight to give our children, including mine still in D220, a voice and a choice to return to full-time in-person learning. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: I think we have already laid out the foundation to open safely and effectively in the spring. Our superintendent has admitted that the biggest hurdle to allowing all students to return is the 6-feet social distancing guidance. Many districts have now adopted a more reasonable 3-feet social distance guideline with great success. We have been told since the beginning that we need to follow the data and the science, well after a year we now have the data and science to prove schools can open safely. Children are not a significant source of transmission, our teachers have all had the opportunity for vaccination, schools that have opened are not seeing a high rate of transmission in the school, reasonable guidelines can be followed to keep our staff and children safe. Districts across the country, including Illinois, have opened fully and successfully. We must put our children first and do whatever it takes to ensure their right to a full educational experience. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: I believe sports should continue at all grade levels during the pandemic. Our children are suffering, school is about so much more than academics. I would take it a step further and say our children deserve to opportunity to return to all extracurricular activities. We need to prioritize our children's mental health and sports and activities play an important part in their overall development.

Judson University's Division of Professional Studies, in partnership with Decision Support Sciences, announced the launch of the nation's first fully applied data science boot camp targeted to corporate education. "The Judson Data Science Bootcamp has a number of critical differentiators," said James A. Libby, CEO of Decision Support Sciences. "We actually went out and asked Fortune 500 and Fortune 2000 firms what they wanted most in a boot camp, and then we built those criteria into the our boot camp." 
Libby said that the JUDS Bootcamp is the first fully applied boot camp that teaches the details of data science by solving real-world corporate problems. The JUDS boot camp is the first nationwide to have simultaneous parallel paths for business professionals, coders, and math/stats professionals, he notes. In another national distinctive, from its inception the boot camp has reserved up to 30 percent of its seats for historically underrepresented populations in STEM disciplines. All students will learn thought-leading content from a team of Ph.D./Educator/Practitioner/Mentors, who collectively have deployed data science-based engagements in 40-plus countries for more than 20 Fortune 500 firms. "Another unique aspect of the JUDS Data Science Bootcamp is that it will allow participants to attend whatever two-week module they desire, from Innovation to Predictive Analytics to Data Visualization to the Data Ecosystem," said Judson University President Gene Crume of the new program offering. "In that sense, it is actually a boot camp of boot camps." The first two cohorts of the JUDS Bootcamp are enrolling participants now. It will launch Sept. 4 and Jan. 8, 2020, at Judson's Elgin campus. Each module of the boot camp, except for the introductory one-week module, is two weeks long and includes 15 hours of hands-on classroom experience with the leading software and platforms in the industry. Professional fees for each module are $2,500, with access to an on-site, advanced laptop provided in the fee structure. "Judson is excited to partner with Decision Support Sciences to offer this new and innovative corporate education program," Crume said. "The JUDS Bootcamp has been created to meet the needs of businesses and industry leaders who need employees that are equipped to make the best data-driven decisions in today's fast-paced and changing environment." Further information regarding the JUDS Bootcamp can be obtained by emailing the bootcamp's enrollment team at juds.bootcamp@judsonu.edu

COD offers foundations of data science certificate
GLEN ELLYN — The new Foundations of Data Science certificate program at College of DuPage prepares students for careers in data analysis fields while providing cross-training for employees who want a sought-after skills set.
Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining.
"The data scientist has been described as the sexiest job of the 21st century," said Christine Monnier, professor of sociology at College of DuPage. "We are awash in a world of data. We now have the power to run massive computations on computers, resulting in more information than ever before. We live in a new world with facts at our fingertips, and anything we do now generates data. But do we know what to do with it?"
Monnier said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. She said that most existing certificates in this field are very specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on the technical aspects of data processing.
For more information about the Foundations of Data Science certificate, visit www.cod.edu/programs/sociology, email monnier@cod.edu or call (630) 942-2438.

Ralf Siemens: 2021 candidate for North Barrington village board Seven candidates for three seats Bio City: North Barrington Age: 58 Occupation: Self-employed Software Product Management – Data Science/Analytics Civic involvement: Big Brothers of Canada – 1996-2000. Calgary Big Brother of the Year – 1998. Lake Zurich Baseball Coach – 2015-2018 Q&amp;A Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state and federal authorities? A: Help people where I can, such as arrange rides as needed. No one, especially elected officials, should stand in the way of county, state, and federal authorities who are doing the best job at organizing and distributing the vaccine. Q: Did your town continue to adequately serve its constituents during the disruptions caused by the pandemic?
 If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: The online presence for self-help services is inadequate. For example, the vehicle stickers should have been a streamlined online process years ago. The pandemic would have been a perfect opportunity to do so. The only thing that went online is payment processing using a cumbersome state system, yet everything is still manual. Automating these functions will increase compliance, thereby increasing revenue. The whole mantra is to make it simple — people will pay if it's simple. Q: In light of our experiences with COVID-19, what safeguards/guidelines should you put in place to address any future public health crises? A: The Village needs to ensure and promote that the scientists and CDC guidance is followed. Q: What cuts can local government make to reduce the burden of the pandemic on taxpayers? A: Local government can ensure that any federal or state aid is distributed fairly to those in need, and if local government does not have a role in that, it should ensure that budgets and budget line items are balanced and any possible downturns in property valuations are prepared for by making contracts flexible so that if revenue declines, contracts decline proportionally. Q: What do you see as the most important infrastructure project you must address? Why and how should it be paid for? Conversely, during these uncertain economic times, what infrastructure project can be put on the back burner? A: The primary project to address is the policing contract. The current contract is with the Lake County Sheriff department and is not fully funded. This impacts other budget line items of the Village's budget; a budget that is not readily available for review currently. Transparency is lacking which affects trustees' ability to review and comment on each line item. Reviewing the Police contract, which is shared with Lake Barrington, is needed to evenly redistribute the burden on both communities. Addressing the police contract will free up funds for road maintenance and flooding issues in order to get the attention they deserve. Q: Do you plan to address businesses that don't adhere to the governor's order to close or restrict business? A: I will fully support adherence to any directive from the county and state's health departments as well as the CDC. Q: Do you agree or disagree with the stance your board/council has taken on permitting recreational marijuana sales in the community? What would you change about that stance, if you could? A: The Village does not have a stance on recreational marijuana sales that I am aware of. I fully support a referendum in North Barrington and let the voters decide this issue if a new revenue stream would be desirable. Currently there are dispensaries in surrounding communities, but the Village does not receive any revenue from those sources. Q: What's one good idea you have to better the community that no one is talking about yet? A: Automate the vehicle sticker program, using a self-help portal. It will increase compliance which is currently only about 50%, increase revenue, reduce the manual labor and associated costs, and encourages automatic annual renewals. I can apply my experience and expertise to oversee the planning, designing, budgeting and the execution of streamlining automation products that simplify services for the residents of North Barrington.

11 candidates for four seats Bio Town: Barrington Age: 44 Occupation: Stay at home mom Civic involvement: Barrington Juniors Women's Club, Barrington Honor Ride and Run, Roslyn Road PTO Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election for the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I have been on the PTO of Roslyn Road for several years and I know firsthand the volunteer efforts that go into keeping our district successful. If elected, I look forward to being able to serve our entire district. 
I am running for three main reasons: I believe our children deserve the option to return to full-time in-person learning. We now know this can be done safely and the harm of keeping our children out of school far outweighs the risk of opening our schools. I believe our Board needs to focus on fiscal responsibility and transparency. Clearly articulate how our tax dollars are being spent and ensure they are allocated in ways that produce the highest returns for our children and taxpayers. I believe in holding our Board accountable to the community. The Board decisions should reflect the voice of the community. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I have been extremely disappointed in the current Board's response to the pandemic. They were never able to work together as a unit in the best interest of our children. Our community was forced to sit through meeting after meeting where little was accomplished, decisions were put off for another month, and our children suffered at home. We had a solid plan to return to school in August, once the Board decided to pull the plug on that plan at the final hour, they spent months trying to invent another option. The fact is, had they stuck with their original plan, we most likely would have had weeks of in-person learning, relationships with teachers, and a solid grasp of materials and technology before having to go remote as cases spiked in our community. Ultimately, I feel that decision set our entire district back. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: I am running to give a voice to constituents. I feel this has been an issue with our BOE for years, they send out survey after survey to solicit the opinion of the community, but decisions made continuously fail to reflect the voice of the community. The Board must have accountability to the taxpayers. The majority of parents have wanted an in-person learning option since August. Instead of moving forward with a plan in August, where 70% of parents chose a return to in-person learning and 30% chose a remote option, the Board "kicked the can" down the road for months. Our children did not return to a consistent hybrid option until January. Our youngest children have not attended a full day of school in a year. Our children a suffering from a mental health crisis and learning loss. Our "middle of the road" children are being lost in the Zoom shuffle. Our Board is exploring a remote option for the 2021/22 school year. We must focus on a safe return to full-time in-person learning for our children. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I feel our teachers did their best with an impossible situation but, were unable to adequately serve students during the pandemic. We ended up making the difficult decision to move our oldest child to St. Anne's in November, a local school that has been open full-time the entire school year. Our son was not able to successfully attend school through Zoom and his grades and mental health were suffering. We tried to work with his school and teachers to get him back on track, many teachers admitted he was not alone in his struggles, but there was only so much they could do through Zoom. We were shocked in the positive change in him after one week of in-person learning. While thankful we were able to make the move to a private school, I know this is not an option for everyone. It has motivated me to fight to give our children, including mine still in D220, a voice and a choice to return to full-time in-person learning. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: I think we have already laid out the foundation to open safely and effectively in the spring. Our superintendent has admitted that the biggest hurdle to allowing all students to return is the 6-feet social distancing guidance. Many districts have now adopted a more reasonable 3-feet social distance guideline with great success. We have been told since the beginning that we need to follow the data and the science, well after a year we now have the data and science to prove schools can open safely. Children are not a significant source of transmission, our teachers have all had the opportunity for vaccination, schools that have opened are not seeing a high rate of transmission in the school, reasonable guidelines can be followed to keep our staff and children safe. Districts across the country, including Illinois, have opened fully and successfully. We must put our children first and do whatever it takes to ensure their right to a full educational experience. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: I believe sports should continue at all grade levels during the pandemic. Our children are suffering, school is about so much more than academics. I would take it a step further and say our children deserve to opportunity to return to all extracurricular activities. We need to prioritize our children's mental health and sports and activities play an important part in their overall development.

Bio City: Inverness Age: 69 Occupation: Retired superintendent from Township High School District 211 Civic involvement: President, Excel Beyond 211, 2014 through present; WINGS Leadership Council, 2012-present; Buehler YMCA board of directors, 2007-present; Harper College Trustee, 2015-2021; Harper College Foundation, 2014-2015 Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: Throughout my 34-year District 211 career, I worked closely with the Harper College administration and staff. I was active with the Harper College Foundation and contributed to the development of the Promise Program. My experiences with the foundation intensified my interest in continuing my service to the community in the capacity of Harper College trustee. 
I am currently retired, and education remains my passion and life's work. My service as a Harper College trustee for the past six years has allowed me to apply the knowledge and past experiences I gained as an educator and community member. Through a second term on the Harper College board, I can continue to volunteer my time and abilities toward the improvement of educational opportunities for adults in our community. I believe that the role of the trustee is to encourage and support innovation that focuses on students' successful completion of degree and certificate programs while meeting the diverse needs of the greater Harper community. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I would give the Harper College administration an "A" grade for their very thorough and measured response to the pandemic. The Harper COVID Response Team did an outstanding job in developing a plan which addressed the following issues: Careful attention was given to indoor traffic flow; temperature screening stations were instituted; a COVID 19 Monitoring Dashboard was created; I.D.'s were required for contact tracing; staff members were trained; students received frequent COVID information, including frequently asked questions and answers; and scheduling of lab classes ensured social distancing and safe practices. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: Harper College closed the campus and established remote learning on March 17, 2020, and simultaneously initiated curbside pickup for students who needed textbooks, Chromebooks, hot spots and supplies. In addition, over $300,000 in Emergency Aid was provided to students who had food or housing insecurity, child-care issues, or other basic needs. Students who were dealing with anxiety, stress, or depression issues were supported through Well Track, a tele mental health services program. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: I believe that the Harper College staff will continue to follow the science and the data in making decisions regarding the return of students to the classroom. We have learned from our experience from the fall that the on-campus interactions in the clinical labs could be conducted safely with small class sizes and having the COVID guidelines in place. Keeping staff members and students safe is the top priority, and Harper College has implemented new cleaning protocols, social distancing, personal protection requirements and temperature checks to assure safety. The risk of COVID transmission is low for aquatics facilities. Harper College in partnership with the Palatine Park District has reopened the pool for swim team practice as of February 2021. Plans are also being made to bring back the Harper coaches and spring athletes for athletic practices in March 2021. We must continue to assess the COVID spread data and the increase in COVID vaccines with the mindset that it is in our students' best interest academically, socially, and emotionally to return to the classroom once it is safe to do so. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: Harper College continued to provide excellent services to the students throughout the pandemic. For the past several years, Harper staff members have been invested in providing distance learning and online course opportunities that provided greater scheduling flexibility for the adult learner population. As a result, they were prepared to make the transition from in person to online classes in March 2020. Certain degree and certificate programs require in-person labs. Harper successfully allowed students to complete the labs from the spring 2020, in July and August 2020. This accommodation allowed students to complete their programs, and no positive COVID cases have been reported. This successful experience allowed Harper to expand the lab classes in August-November of 2020. The protocols in place for check-in stations, temperature checks, I.D.'s checked for contact tracing, and mask requirement were key to opening lab-based classes. Q: In tough economic times, many students (and working professionals) turn to a community college for its educational value. How do you ensure that a person's financial sacrifice results in an educational benefit? A: As trustees, it is our responsibility to monitor the effectiveness of Harper College to ensure students are getting a quality education in a safe environment. Quarterly, trustees receive updates regarding the Operational Plan, Strategic Plan goals, and board and Harper College president goals. Data from these goals are utilized to drive the decisions for the operational and strategic planning of the college. The Institutional Effectiveness measures 10 areas of the Operational Plan. These include items such as facilities, student persistence, student success and areas of risk and strategic planning. Trustees learn whether a goal is completed on target, in progress, postponed, or will not be completed. Trustees are provided the data to assure that students are receiving a quality education. Harper has recently provided 2.2 million dollars in tuition relief for students by freezing tuition, the elimination of distance learning fees, suspending the differential tuition rate for 11 health career majors until spring 2022, the Business EdVantage and in-district tuition for the new Health Information Technology class. I believe Harper provides students an excellent education. Q: From the college's point of view, what budget issues will your district have to confront and what measures do you support to address them? If you believe cuts are necessary, what programs and expenses should be reduced or eliminated? On the income side, do you support any tax or fee increases? A: Harper College's mission is to provide quality, affordable, and accessible education to its community. A guiding principle in determining tax policy should be to ensure the institutional quality of Harper College and its value to the community is maintained. This requires an awareness of the very real fiscal risks and issues caused by uncertainty of state funding. In addition, the state legislation could freeze taxes or shift full pension funding to the college. These risks have been mitigated by the college budgeting conservatively and projecting that they will not receive 100% of the state funding. Annually we review program costs and expenses. Currently, we do not have plans to eliminate programs. I fully support the college recommendation to not raise taxes or have any fee increases for our students. This is the second year that we have not increased student fees. Harper College policy requires reserve fund balances sufficient to provide a surplus to maintain college operations in the event of unexpected adverse economic conditions. I am pleased that Harper College has been able to maintain a balanced budget throughout my tenure on the board.

Bio City: Inverness Age: 76 Occupation: Speech language pathologist; University lecturer retired from Northwestern University Civic involvement: Board member Northwest Community Hospital; advisory board of WINGS; advisory council of The Bridge Youth and Family Services; board member Augustana College Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I have dual passions: Helping students of any age achieve success, and serving the community to help assure equal access to services and opportunities promoting health and well-being. Serving as a trustee of Harper College has provided a platform for sharing my experiences and perspectives from both a career in higher education and volunteer service throughout the district. Over the last 10 years, Harper has gained a reputation for championing student success. 
The board has supported innovations in teaching, advising, increasing student connectivity with faculty and upgrading supportive services and scholarships. These initiatives have contributed to a significant increase in persistence, completion and graduation outcomes. However, there is much more to be done. I hope to assist Harper in continuing to remove barriers to student success such as struggling with finances, balancing work and school attendance, and basic needs such as food and transportation. I want to help assure the community that Harper will continue to be well governed, fiscally strong, innovative and well positioned to work through current and future challenges. A strong board is essential for future success. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I would give Harper high marks for its response. The college leadership working closely with the board as it planned for the decision to close the campus to in person learning on March 17, 2020. Throughout the pandemic, health and safety of students, faculty and staff have been at the center of all decision making. With the assistance of the Academy of Teaching Excellence and online teaching seminars, the faculty quickly pivoted to a distance learning format. Extensive planning was undertaken to limit the use of facilities to essential staff with few entrances and exits available. Upon entrance temperature checks, COVID questions, and electronic monitoring of entrance and exiting were provided. With close attention to science related to COVID, data from the area and guidelines from the CDC, IDPH and Cook County plans were made to open labs in July, and again in the fall, to allow students to complete course assignments with fewer than nine students plus faculty employing physical distancing and mask wearing. Faculty and staff have made numerous contacts with students to check on overall well-being as well as assuring they kept on track. Students have been kept engaged. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: The Harper Community has served students remarkably well. All curriculum and course work was maintained even as remote learning was instituted. The faculty and staff made hundreds of calls to check in with students and keep them on track with needed information about financial aid, registration and advising. Chromebooks and hot spots for wireless interface were provided for students without access. Hawks Care ramped up its emergency aid to students for basic needs. The college and community combined contributions to provide funding for students applying for larger emergency grants. Counseling services were expanded with the opportunity for 24/7 assistance. Labs were reopened when possible to assure students kept pace with technical, health career and academic requirements. In district tuition for students who worked within district boundaries but had lost jobs were allowed to continue with reduced tuition. Communication channels through a special webpage and social media kept students up to date with information about COVID-19. The college deployed 2.7 million dollars of CARES Act funding to 4,400 students each receiving $614. Students have been well served. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: Spring semester is well under way with classes offered remotely with a new opportunity for online/real time courses as an option. Once again, it is hoped that students can return for on-campus labs after March 14. The safety protocols employed on campus and self reporting of faculty and staff were effective. No campus transmission of COVID was reported. All safety measures and restricted student traffic with limited access points will continue. A new electronic self-reporting form will be implemented during spring semester. The Communications team continues to work with the COVID-19 Network of Teams to update communication channels explaining how Harper is serving students remotely. Plans are being made for summer and fall semesters depending upon guidelines and available data. Harper leadership has shown a commitment to a phased approach to returning to campus. For example, in early February, the Building M pool reopened for the Palatine Park District swim team lane training. Later in the month, community members may return to using the pool using a reservation system. After March 15, Harper will review bringing back low risk athletics and more on-campus opportunities. Q: In tough economic times, many students (and working professionals) turn to a community college for its educational value. How do you ensure that a person's financial sacrifice results in an educational benefit? A: Harper is committed to its mission of "providing quality, affordable and accessible education." Students may realize some of all of the benefits outlined here. Begin College Ready: Because of close working relationships with our K-12 partners students may complete dual credits that may shorten courses need for completion and may enroll in the Promise Program to earn two years of free tuition at Harper. Expert advising: Early on select a learning pathway, complete an educational plan and check in to stay on track. Course work: Engage with faculty committed to student success and teaching excellence. Transfer to a 4-year institution: Articulation agreements with both public and private schools makes it a relatively seamless process. Complete certificates: Certificate programs are designed in collaboration with business to match training with jobs. Financial planning: Harper is committed to keeping tuition manageable and a tuition freeze will continue through 2022. Financial assistance opportunities provided 9,700 students a total of 27 million dollars in scholarships, grants and tuition waivers in the 2018-19 academic year. College to Career: Harper transforms individual lives. Q: From the college's point of view, what budget issues will your district have to confront and what measures do you support to address them? If you believe cuts are necessary, what programs and expenses should be reduced or eliminated? On the income side, do you support any tax or fee increases? A: Over 10 years ago, through a collaboration with the entire college community, Harper set forth a financial policy to operate through sound financial policies in line with maintaining a triple AAA Bond Rating. On Feb. 10, 2021, Moody's reaffirmed this rating with a stable outlook noting the college's low reliance on state of Illinois funding and plan to close out 2021 in June with a surplus. The benefit to the community is notable as interest charged on Harper's obligations is significantly reduced with this rating. Budget cuts are not anticipated at this time. All position vacancies are carefully reviewed before being replaced and comprehensive program reviews take place on a multiyear cycle. Financial planning is done annually with a five-year projection. Enrollment is expected to be flat for the next few cycles and the impact will need to be carefully monitored. In the near term, funding from the CARES Act and the more recently passed CRRSA Act will lessen the impact of reduced tuition income. Strong fiscal stewardship is a top priority for the Harper board.

SCF is creating a predictive order technology for the CPG Industry and wholesalers. The technology predicts if an item will be ordered, and provides line item level quantities. The technology is intended to supplement or replace sales representatives' order entry calculations at CPG customer sites. 
SCF builds quantitative models to predict item orders. Consumer packaged goods companies interested in collaborating with Smart Cloud Forge are encouraged to reach out. Smart Cloud Forge is requesting transactional data sets. "A CPG Company with transactional data set would be a valuable partner as we continue to improve our models. We currently have an item accuracy rate of 91.4%. However, we can keep building on this, improving our models and processes," states Smart Cloud Forge C.E.O., Heather Wigell. There's a range of potential benefits from collaboration, and SCF will meet with interested partners to discuss the details on a case by case basis. Smart Cloud Forge was founded in 2019 by Douglas Macleod. He has spent over 20 years in IT, with roles ranging from applications development consultant to Director of Applications Development at Pepsi. MacLeod has spent time at major beverage manufacturing and distribution companies such as Pepsi, DS Waters, and other distributors specializing in mobile field workforce computing, warehouse and delivery operations. MacLeod transitioned from a project management role to a technical role with the founding of SCF. His technical expertise includes all major databases, Objective C, Java and Python. Heather Wigell was named CEO at Smart Cloud Forge. Wigell originally provided a client facing solution for the predictive order technology, importing results into Tableau creating data visualizations of the historical data and predictive order data. Wigell has worked in marketing and research for 10 years. Her specialty is synthesizing research, marketing and data science to form a data-driven strategy, define customer segments, and provide data visualizations.

Bio Town: Addison Age: 43 Occupation: Technology administrator at a school district in Cook County Civic involvement: Addison District 4 board since 2017. I have been involved in my local school PTA for the last 7 years. Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you? A: The issue I am most passionate about is community engagement. 
Now more than ever it's absolutely imperative that a school board engages effectively with the community it serves. By engaging the community, we can ensure that all voices are heard and included while ensuring transparency. During my first term, I worked with the superintendent to lay the foundation for the district's first-ever Community Advisory Council. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? A: The board followed the science and the data from the local county health department. In addition the board surveyed parents and teachers in the fall. That information was used to formulate a plan to safely bring students back in small groups in the fall while ensuring the safety of students and staff. I think given the constantly evolving (and, at times contradictory) guidance from state and local authorities, the board did a great job given the extremely challenging situation. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: I think it's important to acknowledge here that depending on the situation all three roles are important. In March of 2020, the district had no choice but to quickly pivot to remote learning based on the governor's stay at home order. In the fall, we knew that many students were struggling with remote learning so we offered students a hybrid learning option who needed in person instruction. While this was an unpopular decision the board felt very strongly that parents should have the option of sending their students to school. Recognizing that we needed to provide continuity for students who were benefiting from remote learning, we offered parents the option of keeping their students at home. Ultimately a school board's focal responsibility is to the children it serves. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? A: The board collaborated with High School District 88 and elementary school districts 45 and 48 to serve breakfast and lunch at no cost for all children in the communities of Addison, Oakbrook Terrace, and Villa Park. Together with our food service companies, the four school districts have provided meals to all children since the pandemic started in March 2020, including during the summer months and school breaks. In Addison alone, we have provided nearly 200,000 meals in the past 11 months! In addition to protect the continuity of learning the district worked with every family to ensure students had adequate internet access at home to participate in remote learning. Internet hot spots were provided to those families who lacked adequate access at home. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: One of the things we learned in the fall is the challenge of teaching students in a hybrid setting. Our plan for the spring is to ensure that our teachers have the appropriate tools, training and resources to provide hybrid instruction. In addition, we are looking for ways to engage students to build relationships with them so that they feel comfortable. To address those needs the district has elected to use all of its additional remote learning planning days that were made available by the state board of education. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: Our school district is a K-8 district so this does not apply to us. Having said that as long as it is safe to do so I support allowing high school sports to continue.

Missteps could mar long-term credibility of AstraZeneca shot

Byline: Associated Press "This is unfortunately more about perception than it is the science," said Dr. Bharat Pankhania, an infectious diseases specialist at Britain's University of Exeter. "We have now seen, on several parameters, that the AstraZeneca vaccine provides protection and is safe," he said. "But the narrative for the public has not been as clear." France is a prime example of the confusion. French President Emmanuel Macron initially suggested the vaccine wasn't effective for older people, before backtracking. Still, France only authorized AstraZeneca's vaccine for use in adults 65 and under, citing a lack of data. Then the government changed its mind, based on new data, and said it's fine for all adults. But when there were reports of rare blood clots in some vaccine recipients, the government suspended use of the shot all together. When France restarted AstraZeneca, it banned the shot for anyone under 55. The whiplash-inducing messages come at a time when France — like much of continental Europe — is struggling to speed up its vaccination drive while also facing a spike in cases that is close to overwhelming its hospitals and prompting threats of new lockdowns. At a European Parliament committee Tuesday in Brussels, Sandra Gallina, head of the European Commission's health directorate, described the situation with AstraZeneca as "a shame." She said the struggling vaccination campaigns across Europe were "made much more difficult by the bad performance of AstraZeneca." The company has blamed delays in its deliveries on production issues. Even if the drugmaker clears up the latest misunderstanding, it could have a lasting impact. Julian Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester, pointed to the decades-old controversy over the measles vaccine as a cautionary tale.

LONDON — AstraZeneca's repeated missteps in reporting vaccine data coupled with a blood clot scare could do lasting damage to the credibility of a shot that is the linchpin in the global strategy to stop the coronavirus pandemic, potentially even undermining vaccine confidence more broadly, experts say. The latest stumble for the vaccine came Tuesday, when American officials issued an unusual statement expressing concern that AstraZeneca had included "outdated information" when it reported encouraging results from a U.S. trial a day earlier. That may have provided "an incomplete view of the efficacy data," according to the statement. AstraZeneca responded that the results, which showed its shot was about 79% effective, included information through Feb. 
17 but appeared to be consistent with more up-to-date data. It promised an update within 48 hours. An independent panel that oversees the study scolded the company in a letter Monday for cherry-picking data, according to a senior administration official. The panel wrote to AstraZeneca and U.S. health leaders that it was concerned the company chose to use data that was outdated and potentially misleading instead of the most recent findings, according to the official. "This will likely cause more vaccine hesitancy," said Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. Even if the damage is limited to AstraZeneca itself, it would have far-reaching effects since the shot is cheaper and easier to store than many of its rivals' and thus is expected to be widely used in the developing world. International health agencies have repeatedly said the vaccine is safe and effective, but it's not the first time the company has run into problems with public trust. Partial results from its first major trial — which Britain used to authorize the vaccine — were clouded by a manufacturing mistake that researchers didn't immediately acknowledge. Insufficient data about how well the vaccine protected older people led some countries to initially restrict its use to younger populations before reversing course. U.S. officials suspended an AstraZeneca study for an unusual six weeks while they sought details about problems reported in Britain before deciding the vaccine wasn't to blame. Meanwhile, the European Union has complained about delays in vaccine deliveries from the company. Then last week, more than a dozen countries temporarily halted their use of the AstraZeneca shot after reports of rare blood clots in some people who received it. The European Medicines Agency concluded the shot did not increase the overall incidence of clots, but the unwanted attention appears to have left a mark. In Norway, a top official warned Monday it might not be able to resume its use of the vaccine because so many people were rejecting it. "People clearly say that they do not want the AstraZeneca vaccine," Marte Kvittum Tangen, who heads a Norwegian doctors' association, told broadcaster NRK. Last week in Bucharest, Romania, vaccination coordinator Valeriu Gheorghita said 33,000 AstraZeneca immunization appointments had been canceled in 24 hours and that about a third of the 10,000 people scheduled to receive the vaccine did not show up. In Belgrade, Serbia, a sprawling exhibition center set up for people to get the AstraZeneca vaccine was mostly deserted on Monday. Other countries with larger populations and fewer options have accepted China's vaccines, sometimes after considerable griping from top leaders. Brazil, South America's most populous country, has adopted Sinovac's vaccine after initial resistance from President Jair Bolsonaro. The Philippines accepted a donation of Sinovac vaccines from China last month, despite President Rodrigo Duterte saying he personally wants to take a different Chinese vaccine, according to Reuters. Vaccine makers usually release details of their Phase 3 clinical trials in peer-reviewed journals before the vaccines gain regulatory approval. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna published theirs in the New England Journal of Medicine in December. Sinopharm and Sinovac have self-reported some key results, but they have not published the underlying data in a journal, which would require vetting by third-party experts. Chinese government officials and industry executives have largely deflected questions about when they will release the data. In an interview with state-run tabloid Global Times this month, Shao Yiming, a vaccine expert with China's CDC, claimed that the countries where Sinovac and Sinopharm ran trials — including Brazil and the UAE — must be the ones to release it. "Whether to release the clinical trial data, when and how, must be decided by the foreign institutions," Shao said. "China has no power to decide." At a Beijing news conference on March 15, health regulators ignored a question on when data will be released, according to the transcript. Sinopharm and Sinovac executives also have not addressed the question. More than 60 countries have approved one of China's coronavirus vaccines for market use or emergency use, according to the China International Development Cooperation Agency. Malaysia began using Sinovac's vaccine this month, after kicking off its vaccination drive with limited supplies of vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca, which developed a shot with Oxford University. Malaysia's science minister, Khairy Jamaluddin, took the first shot of the Sinovac vaccine to shore up confidence. "I want to say, it is safe," he wrote in Chinese on Twitter after receiving the first dose. "I feel great. And my Chinese has suddenly gotten better." Chinese leader Xi Jinping has yet to publicly take a vaccine. Sinopharm said this month more than 5,000 senior officials attending the country's annual legislative session had been vaccinated. In Hong Kong, vaccine mistrust has jumped after seven people died following Sinovac doses and one after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although no causation has been established. The Chinese territory has expanded its vaccine program to include anyone over 30, who can choose from either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or Sinovac's, after priority groups were reluctant to take up the shots. That is a situation Singapore is trying to avoid, experts say, as it could delay the reopening of borders and the economy. English, the communicable-disease expert, said vaccine makers typically publish clinical trial results transparently to build public trust. This is especially critical during a pandemic, where public indecision about whether to get a vaccine costs lives. Singapore's ministry of health said that it received its first shipment of Sinovac doses on Feb. 23. The country's Health Sciences Authority said this week it has begun reviewing the data that Sinovac had submitted, but it needs more information from the company. Regulators are "still waiting for the company to submit the data," the Health Sciences Authority said. — — — The Washington Post's Alicia Chen in Taipei, Taiwan, and Lyric Li in Seoul contributed to this report. vaccine-china

Startup makes data science a sport

SAN FRANCISCO — Strange secrets hide in numbers. For instance, an orange used car is least likely to be a lemon.
This particular unexpected finding came to light courtesy of a data jockey who goes by the Internet alias SirGuessalot, who in fact wasn't guessing at all. Instead, he and his partner, PlanetThanet, relied on the hard math skills that make them top contenders in a sport tailor-made for the 21st century: competitive number-crunching.
The used car defect prediction contest is one of dozens hosted by San Francisco online startup Kaggle, whose creators believe they can tap the global geek population's instinct for one-upmanship to mine better answers faster from the world's ever-rising mountain of data.
"Competitions bring together a wide variety of people into a wide variety of problems," said Jeremy Howard, who became Kaggle's president and chief scientist after winning multiple competitions himself. "You get people looking at stuff they'd never look at otherwise."
While the used car contest was fun, Kaggle has its eye on weightier scientific problems. In one contest, an English major who trained himself in data science built a model for predicting the progress of HIV infections in individual patients. In another, a scientist who studies glaciers for a living won a NASA-backed Kaggle competition to measure the shapes of galaxies by mapping the universe's dark matter.
The data problems that need solving are so important that those who find the solutions should be paid like professional athletes, said Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom. By turning data-mining into a crowdsourced contest, he hopes he's created a way to make that happen. Already one of Kaggle's contests offers a multimillion dollar prize.
"We want to see the best data scientists earning more than Tiger Woods," said Goldbloom, who started the company in his native Australia and recently came to San Francisco's South of Market startup haven.
The job market for mathematicians and statisticians has become hot as the sheer volume of data generated by ever faster, cheaper computing resources explodes.
Data storage has become so inexpensive that a 2011 McKinsey and Co. report estimated that a disk drive capable of storing all the world's music would cost about $600. Walmart stores 10 times more data on customer transactions and other parts of its operation than is contained in the entire Library of Congress, according to the same report.
Analyzing the so-called "big data" deluge has become a key task for businesses in an effort to divine everything from which ads online customers will click to how much inventory they need to maintain. Political candidates analyze data to predict voting patterns. Dating websites try to predict ideal mates.
Kaggle competitions focus on creating and testing formulas that can be used to make predictions based on the contents of giant data sets.
The more accurate the formula, the better the chances it will accurately provide answers to complex questions, such as the orange used car.
Goldbloom argues that no matter how many data scientists companies hire, relying on in-house data talent means companies can't know if they're getting the best solution.
In a Kaggle contest, competitors find out as soon as they submit their solutions how they stack up against fellow contestants. They can keep trying for the duration of the typically three-month contests, which are highlighted on the company website.
As the first entries come in, the accuracy of competing models improves by leaps, Goldbloom said. As the contests progress, the improvement curve flattens out. Goldbloom and Howard believe that shows the competitive approach pushes data scientists toward the best solutions within human reach.
"Crowdsourcing allows you to squeeze data dry," Goldbloom said.
Not all competitions are open to all comers, however. About 33,000 contestants have taken part in Kaggle's public competitions, where prize money tends to top out at around $10,000. Winners can get invited to participate in elite private contests, which may include access to sensitive private data sets.
Kaggle's business model depends on deep-pocketed contest sponsors like banks seeking to outdo each other with more lucrative prize purses to attract the best competitors, who themselves in theory could then make their livings off Kaggle competitions alone.
The biggest prize by far open to the public is $3 million offered by the California-based Heritage Provider Network medical group to the data scientist best able to use hospital admission records to predict the profiles of people most likely to end up in the hospital. The next-biggest purse is $100,000 in prizes put up by the Hewlett Foundation for algorithms that can automatically grade student essays.
In its grandest vision of itself, the 11-person company backed by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin will have tens of thousands of competitions running simultaneously. Guilds of data gurus will band together to unleash software that enters competitions automatically. Kaggle becomes not just a way to push humans to perform at their best but to make machines themselves smarter as code-based contestants battle and "learn" from their mistakes.
In this way, Howard said, data competitions become steps along the development of artificial intelligence systems such as self-driving cars.
As for why orange used cars are most likely to be in good shape, the numbers did not hold the answer. One notion was that such a flashy color would only attract car fanatics who would be more likely to take care of their vehicles. That didn't pan out, however, since the least well-kept used cars turned out to be purple.

Five Candidates — Four 4-year terms Bio Hometown: Arlington Heights Age: 39 Occupation: Lawyer (in-house corporate counsel) Employer: Syntellis Performance Solutions, LLC (10 S. Wacker Dr., Suite 3375, Chicago, IL 60606) Civic involvement: Member of the CCSD 59 Board of Education since March 2020 Q&amp;A Q. Why are you running for this office? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A. I am running for the school board for two reasons. First, I want to advocate for high quality, rigorous, and equitable learning opportunities for all children. 
The children in District 59 have the right to an education that will equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate, compete, and succeed in a global society. Second, I want to advocate for families — in particular those who may feel underrepresented and/or excluded as decision-makers in their children's education. Families play a key role in the education of their children and home-school relationships are vital to supporting students' academic achievement. I was raised to value education and have personally experienced how transformative a quality education can be to a family and its future generations. I want this for all children and families in District 59. Q. How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A. I am a member of the current School Board. I know first hand that we put the safety of our students, staff, and community first. During a recent school board meeting I stated that the best we can do is rely on the data, the science, and the experts when analyzing the best way to take action. We have made difficult decisions. We are currently expanding our hybrid model so that more students can return and learn in a safe environment four days a week. I will continue to rely on the data and the guidance from the Illinois Department of Health and CDC when analyzing this issue and taking action. Q. How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A. I provided authentic, transparent leadership when making decisions regarding school closures and the pandemic. I have been very vocal throughout this process. I have clearly articulated why I am voting a certain way or why I believe the board should take certain actions. The community should understand why I am taking certain actions on the Board. I do not disregard or ignore the members who may disagree with me. I often ask questions of the administration based on comments I receive from community members who may disagree with my position. I have made every effort to be straightforward and transparent in my decisions during the pandemic. Ultimately, I represent the members of the community and take their requests and concerns seriously. Q. Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A. The District continued to provide over 450,000 meals to students during the pandemic. The District provided Wi-Fi hotspots and technology support for our students and their parents. Certain students were able to attend in person classes to receive specialized attention. However, the services we provide to address disruptions caused by the pandemic are only just beginning as we expand our return to school hybrid model. All options must be on the table to address any learning loss or negative impacts caused the pandemic. In addition, we need to ensure that we provide professional learning opportunities for staff who have also been impacted. This work must continue throughout the end of the 2021 school year, into the summer school offering, and beyond. Q. Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A. The District will follow the guidance from the Illinois Department of Health and ensure that our students and staff wear masks, maintain social distancing, wash hands, and clean their work spaces. These are the basic steps. However, the District has done more to strengthen these mitigation strategies including ventilation upgrades, specialized cleaning supplies and sprays, and plexiglass barriers for all students. We need to ensure that our students can return to a safe and comfortable learning environment this Spring. Q. What other issues need to be addressed? A. 2020 was a difficult year for our students and families. We must learn from it. We must become stronger from it. There are issues that are important to our students such as diversity, equity and inclusion efforts that must continue to be addressed and improved. Moreover, our students must have the tools to compete and succeed in a global society and this includes strengthening our curriculum. We must continue to review our processes and improve them. We should always strive to do things better. We cannot be content with where things stand.

Ten candidates are vying for four, 4-year terms on the Wheaton Warrenville Unit District 200 school board in the April 6, 2021, election. Bio City: Wheaton Age: 55 Occupation: Architect at Wight &amp; Company Civic involvement: I am nearing completion of my eighth year on the school board. I have served as board secretary, vice president, and for the past two plus years as president. Q&amp;A Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it?
 A. The survey relates only to pandemic response. The responsibility of the board is much broader. Seven board members will be seated as this school year is concluding. Any candidates running because they wanted schools open will have no impact this school year. I am seeking reelection because I know that road ahead requires experience, perspective, and deep understanding of our district. Once we get past this school year, the board will have major responsibility including contract renewals with our unions and Superintendent, prioritizing a plan to address the social-emotional wellness needs of students and staff, and bridging any learning gaps in a targeted manner as we go into next school year. We need to continue implementation of our Equity/Proactive Practices work plan and evolve our community engagement approach to help bring "healing" to the community following the disruptions and division caused by the pandemic — and exacerbated on social media. Our Portrait of a Graduate initiative needs to be completed after being paused last spring. As always, the Board must continue strong financial stewardship while staying on track with our facility improvement program. Q. How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A. I think the District has done a very good job. The Board's role is governance. We need to hear everyone, ask questions, provide feedback and speak to many different perspectives. It is impossible to be perfect in a situation that has never happened in our lifetimes. There was no road map for how to achieve this and the guidance from our state and various health departments has been frustrating. On Sept 16, the Daily Herald called District 200 "a bellwether for school reopening efforts in the pandemic." Our early childhood and elementary schools have been open five days per week from day one without a pause. Our secondary schools are back after a tough fall. We continue to create and implement ways to bring more students safely into the schools while working within the public health guidance provided to us by the medical experts. At the secondary level, we are providing four full days of instruction per week (two in person/two through livestream remote). Balancing the needs of students and the desires of teachers and parents has been a challenge. I am proud of what we have accomplished. Q. How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A. For over two years I have served as Board President. I understand the role and have personally felt the anger, frustration, and praise from community members. It has been a team effort and a good leader needs to recognize what we have achieved. My role has been to keep people together, remain focused on making sure all voices are heard, while assuring the operational decisions made by our leadership teams strike the right balance across all voices we have heard from. It is important to recognize that since this pandemic began the role of school district has expanded this year. We have played a role in assisting getting food to families in need, provided screening/testing of students and staff for COVID-19, been asked to coordinate vaccination of our teachers, and have had to become fluent in the science, data, and politics of a virus unknown barely 12 months ago. The role is not about picking sides and deciding who to listen to. It is about balancing the needs and concerns of all voices and health experts to keep moving the ball forward. That is what we have done this school year and I am proud of our team's efforts. Q. Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A. Adequate is viewed differently through the lens of each person. That is consistent through each school year. The year, we know there are people that do not feel the District has adequately served students, while others say we have done an outstanding job. I know that our peers and benchmark districts admire how we have handled this year and call us a model district. Specific examples of how we have adjusted include shifting to a livestream model at high school through a hybrid approach — allowing us to abandon the high school virtual academy. This provided curriculum consistency, but also impacted flexibility of Wednesday asynchronous day. We also altered our middle school day for second semester to model our high school's "concurrent instruction" model. We have built out an entire virtual academy with dedicated school principals and teachers. We are currently exploring the possibility of expanding the in-person elementary day but are identifying several complications. We have established new attendance policies to expand our high school in person opportunities for students that need it and will be bring some student back for four days per week of in-person instruction. Q. Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A. District 200 is already safely conducting classes and beginning to implement ways to expand our in person model in March. Based on what we have learned, we have already shifted our middle school model for the second semester and recently modified the Wednesday asynchronous day for middle school students. If there was one area I wish we could enhance it would be our asynchronous day at the high schools. However, I recognize that there are good reasons and rational for the structure of that day as an important opportunity for teachers to connect with students that have opted for the fully remote option. The fact that we maintained the virtual academy at the middle school level and did not at the high school level complicates the situation. We also added optional surveillance testing of students and staff as an enhanced mitigation strategy to assure a safe learning environment and to prevent other students being removed from in-person learning due to a close contact definitions. Q. What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A. The decision on high school sports is not a local decision. Certainly, I wish our student athletes did not have the rug pulled out from under them this fall and winter. I wish the state could have found a way. I am happy the sports season has started for our students. However, from my perspective, playing competitive sports would have also required other schools and conferences to make the same choice to play. So even if it were a local choice, competitive high school sports with other schools likely never could have happened until the IHSA acted. Equally important is the opportunity to relaunch co-curricular activities for our students. This is already underway, and more students are at the schools as a result. I think this decision also needs to be recognized as an important decision for students.

Four candidates are running for three, 4-year trustee seats on the Carol Stream village board. Two incumbents, Rick Gieser and Matt McCarthy, are seeking reelection. The challengers are Jeff Berger and Erik Crawford. The Daily Herald posed questions to the trustee hopefuls in the April 6 election. 
Below are Crawford's responses. For more election coverage, visit dailyherald.com. Bio City: Carol Stream Age: 48 Occupation: Director of Operations, Sound Incorporated Civic involvement: Local volunteer, former part-time Carol Stream firefighter Q&amp;A Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state and federal authorities? A: As a board member I would listen to our residents and local business owners on what they need and the concerns they have. I would work with our other board members to address the concerns and come up with a proper game plan for everyone involved. I would stay within State and Federal guidelines as long as the medical data and science backed the suggested restrictions. I will always lean toward the well-being of the citizens of Carol Stream as well as the livelihood of small business's within our community. Q: Did your town continue to adequately serve its constituents during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I believe Carol Stream responded to the Pandemic swiftly and responsibly. The village moved all local gatherings to public Zoom meetings and they restricted access to public gathering places according to State mandates. I think the open communication with the residents was good and that the board and Mayor did an outstanding job. Q: In light of our experiences with COVID-19, what safeguards/guidelines should you put in place to address any future public health crises? A: I hate to say that a global Pandemic is a good test of a Village and its response to such, but that's exactly what this was and we as a Village responded admirably. The cooperation of residents and local business's shows how strong of a community we have and the outpouring of community support by individuals was beyond impressive. I would hope that there are pieces that we learn from, the good, the bad and that we work together to always be better prepared in the future. Q: What cuts can local government make to reduce the burden of the pandemic on taxpayers? A: Carol Stream is a fiscally responsible town with a balanced budget and a board that prides itself on maintaining this moving into the future. I hope that I am able to present an outside look into future spending and maybe find more creative ways to spend but get the same result in the end. It is very important that we spend money in the proper areas so we can maintain a safe, clean, family oriented place to live. Q: What do you see as the most important infrastructure project you must address? Why and how should it be paid for? Conversely, during these uncertain economic times, what infrastructure project can be put on the back burner? A: Luckily for Carol Stream residents most of the large infrastructure project's have been completed in previous years. Carol Stream is in beautiful shape and previous boards have made sure this continues to happen moving into the future. I think our priority should always be the safety of the residents and ensuring that we are bringing in local business's that compliment who we are as a community. Q. Do you plan to address businesses that don't adhere to the governor's order to close or restrict business? A. The state of Illinois is bound by a Constitution and as long as those rules are followed, I will support any orders given by the Governor or the State. I believe it is very important as a local government, if rules are set forth that are unconstitutional that we stand with other local communities to let the Governor and State know we are in disagreement and we will not adhere to unconstitutional mandates. Q: Do you agree or disagree with the stance your board has taken on permitting recreational marijuana sales in the community? What would you change about that stance, if you could? A: The state of Illinois is bound by a Constitution and as long as those rules are followed, I will support any orders given by the Governor or the State. I believe it is very important as a local government, if rules are set forth that are unconstitutional that we stand with other local communities to let the Governor and State know we are in disagreement and we will not adhere to unconstitutional mandates. Q: What's one good idea you have to better the community that no one is talking about yet? A: Unfortunately right now is the wrong time to talk about good ideas as they tend to cost money. In order to stay safe and continue to give the residents what they expect from us as a board, we need to stay the coarse of fiscal responsibility. We need to look at new business that compliments what we are as a village and what we stand for. We need to look at more creative ways to cut spending without sacrificing the services our residents expect.

Bio City: Inverness Age: 69 Occupation: Retired superintendent from Township High School District 211 Civic involvement: President, Excel Beyond 211, 2014 through present; WINGS Leadership Council, 2012-present; Buehler YMCA board of directors, 2007-present; Harper College Trustee, 2015-2021; Harper College Foundation, 2014-2015 Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: Throughout my 34-year District 211 career, I worked closely with the Harper College administration and staff. I was active with the Harper College Foundation and contributed to the development of the Promise Program. My experiences with the foundation intensified my interest in continuing my service to the community in the capacity of Harper College trustee. 
I am currently retired, and education remains my passion and life's work. My service as a Harper College trustee for the past six years has allowed me to apply the knowledge and past experiences I gained as an educator and community member. Through a second term on the Harper College board, I can continue to volunteer my time and abilities toward the improvement of educational opportunities for adults in our community. I believe that the role of the trustee is to encourage and support innovation that focuses on students' successful completion of degree and certificate programs while meeting the diverse needs of the greater Harper community. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I would give the Harper College administration an "A" grade for their very thorough and measured response to the pandemic. The Harper COVID Response Team did an outstanding job in developing a plan which addressed the following issues: Careful attention was given to indoor traffic flow; temperature screening stations were instituted; a COVID 19 Monitoring Dashboard was created; I.D.'s were required for contact tracing; staff members were trained; students received frequent COVID information, including frequently asked questions and answers; and scheduling of lab classes ensured social distancing and safe practices. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: Harper College closed the campus and established remote learning on March 17, 2020, and simultaneously initiated curbside pickup for students who needed textbooks, Chromebooks, hot spots and supplies. In addition, over $300,000 in Emergency Aid was provided to students who had food or housing insecurity, child-care issues, or other basic needs. Students who were dealing with anxiety, stress, or depression issues were supported through Well Track, a tele mental health services program. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: I believe that the Harper College staff will continue to follow the science and the data in making decisions regarding the return of students to the classroom. We have learned from our experience from the fall that the on-campus interactions in the clinical labs could be conducted safely with small class sizes and having the COVID guidelines in place. Keeping staff members and students safe is the top priority, and Harper College has implemented new cleaning protocols, social distancing, personal protection requirements and temperature checks to assure safety. The risk of COVID transmission is low for aquatics facilities. Harper College in partnership with the Palatine Park District has reopened the pool for swim team practice as of February 2021. Plans are also being made to bring back the Harper coaches and spring athletes for athletic practices in March 2021. We must continue to assess the COVID spread data and the increase in COVID vaccines with the mindset that it is in our students' best interest academically, socially, and emotionally to return to the classroom once it is safe to do so. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: Harper College continued to provide excellent services to the students throughout the pandemic. For the past several years, Harper staff members have been invested in providing distance learning and online course opportunities that provided greater scheduling flexibility for the adult learner population. As a result, they were prepared to make the transition from in person to online classes in March 2020. Certain degree and certificate programs require in-person labs. Harper successfully allowed students to complete the labs from the spring 2020, in July and August 2020. This accommodation allowed students to complete their programs, and no positive COVID cases have been reported. This successful experience allowed Harper to expand the lab classes in August-November of 2020. The protocols in place for check-in stations, temperature checks, I.D.'s checked for contact tracing, and mask requirement were key to opening lab-based classes. Q: In tough economic times, many students (and working professionals) turn to a community college for its educational value. How do you ensure that a person's financial sacrifice results in an educational benefit? A: As trustees, it is our responsibility to monitor the effectiveness of Harper College to ensure students are getting a quality education in a safe environment. Quarterly, trustees receive updates regarding the Operational Plan, Strategic Plan goals, and board and Harper College president goals. Data from these goals are utilized to drive the decisions for the operational and strategic planning of the college. The Institutional Effectiveness measures 10 areas of the Operational Plan. These include items such as facilities, student persistence, student success and areas of risk and strategic planning. Trustees learn whether a goal is completed on target, in progress, postponed, or will not be completed. Trustees are provided the data to assure that students are receiving a quality education. Harper has recently provided 2.2 million dollars in tuition relief for students by freezing tuition, the elimination of distance learning fees, suspending the differential tuition rate for 11 health career majors until spring 2022, the Business EdVantage and in-district tuition for the new Health Information Technology class. I believe Harper provides students an excellent education. Q: From the college's point of view, what budget issues will your district have to confront and what measures do you support to address them? If you believe cuts are necessary, what programs and expenses should be reduced or eliminated? On the income side, do you support any tax or fee increases? A: Harper College's mission is to provide quality, affordable, and accessible education to its community. A guiding principle in determining tax policy should be to ensure the institutional quality of Harper College and its value to the community is maintained. This requires an awareness of the very real fiscal risks and issues caused by uncertainty of state funding. In addition, the state legislation could freeze taxes or shift full pension funding to the college. These risks have been mitigated by the college budgeting conservatively and projecting that they will not receive 100% of the state funding. Annually we review program costs and expenses. Currently, we do not have plans to eliminate programs. I fully support the college recommendation to not raise taxes or have any fee increases for our students. This is the second year that we have not increased student fees. Harper College policy requires reserve fund balances sufficient to provide a surplus to maintain college operations in the event of unexpected adverse economic conditions. I am pleased that Harper College has been able to maintain a balanced budget throughout my tenure on the board.

Companies seek to capitalize on big data

Williams-Sonoma uses big data to determine the best way to target individual customers, whether through online ads, emails or catalogs. Amazon has leveraged big data to improve customer service.
Companies and organizations everywhere are seeking to capitalize on big data, generally defined as the explosion in the volume, availability and quality of data in an environment of rapidly changing digital technologies. While still an emerging field, most sectors of the economy — especially the business sector — are starting to use big data to explore new markets, sell more products, operate more efficiently and serve the public good.
As a result, the need has never been higher for professionals who can analyze and leverage these large sets of data, in fields ranging from marketing and finance to public- and private-sector research. A 2011 report from the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated a shortage "of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills, as well as a shortage of 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions."
Colleges and universities play a leading role in producing more of these specially trained professionals. Leading-edge practitioners of data science are looking for data experts with proven skills in analytics, computer/information science and business — the whole package of quantitative, technical and business insight. But what they often see are job candidates with either technical skills or business experience, not both. Contributing to the challenge, many graduate programs focus on only one of those areas.
Last fall, Elmhurst College welcomed students to its new master's degree program in data science, a comprehensive program that provides both the technical skills to develop and manage large data sets, as well as the vital business skills to glean and apply knowledge from them in meaningful ways. In addition to their studies of the technical aspects of data science, students complete two master's-level courses in a field directly related to their specific areas of interest. The result is a strong, broad foundation of knowledge that graduates can apply to a wide variety of industries and professional settings.
For students' convenience at Elmhurst, the program is offered in a part-time, completely online format, and may be completed in as little as two years. Elmhurst College also offers a graduate certificate in data science.
Interest in the program has been keen and diverse. As a startup, the Elmhurst program anticipated enrolling about 10 new students in the first year. The program has 35 students, and is drawing interest from people across many industries, including health care, financial services, publishing and supply chain.
Career opportunities in data science include, data mining specialists, data scientists, engineers, business analysts, marketing managers, market research analysts, strategic planning analysts and information systems managers.
In a CNBC.com story headlined "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century: Data Analyst," Rob Bearden, CEO of Hortonworks, says, "The desire on the enterprise side to find truly qualified data scientists has resulted in almost open head count. It's probably the biggest imbalance of supply and demand that I've ever seen in my career. ... The talent pool is, at best, probably 20 percent of the demand."
* James Kulich and John Jeffrey are co-directors of the master's in data science program at Elmhurst College.

Bio City: Inverness Age: 76 Occupation: Speech language pathologist; University lecturer retired from Northwestern University Civic involvement: Board member Northwest Community Hospital; advisory board of WINGS; advisory council of The Bridge Youth and Family Services; board member Augustana College Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I have dual passions: Helping students of any age achieve success, and serving the community to help assure equal access to services and opportunities promoting health and well-being. Serving as a trustee of Harper College has provided a platform for sharing my experiences and perspectives from both a career in higher education and volunteer service throughout the district. Over the last 10 years, Harper has gained a reputation for championing student success. 
The board has supported innovations in teaching, advising, increasing student connectivity with faculty and upgrading supportive services and scholarships. These initiatives have contributed to a significant increase in persistence, completion and graduation outcomes. However, there is much more to be done. I hope to assist Harper in continuing to remove barriers to student success such as struggling with finances, balancing work and school attendance, and basic needs such as food and transportation. I want to help assure the community that Harper will continue to be well governed, fiscally strong, innovative and well positioned to work through current and future challenges. A strong board is essential for future success. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I would give Harper high marks for its response. The college leadership working closely with the board as it planned for the decision to close the campus to in person learning on March 17, 2020. Throughout the pandemic, health and safety of students, faculty and staff have been at the center of all decision making. With the assistance of the Academy of Teaching Excellence and online teaching seminars, the faculty quickly pivoted to a distance learning format. Extensive planning was undertaken to limit the use of facilities to essential staff with few entrances and exits available. Upon entrance temperature checks, COVID questions, and electronic monitoring of entrance and exiting were provided. With close attention to science related to COVID, data from the area and guidelines from the CDC, IDPH and Cook County plans were made to open labs in July, and again in the fall, to allow students to complete course assignments with fewer than nine students plus faculty employing physical distancing and mask wearing. Faculty and staff have made numerous contacts with students to check on overall well-being as well as assuring they kept on track. Students have been kept engaged. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: The Harper Community has served students remarkably well. All curriculum and course work was maintained even as remote learning was instituted. The faculty and staff made hundreds of calls to check in with students and keep them on track with needed information about financial aid, registration and advising. Chromebooks and hot spots for wireless interface were provided for students without access. Hawks Care ramped up its emergency aid to students for basic needs. The college and community combined contributions to provide funding for students applying for larger emergency grants. Counseling services were expanded with the opportunity for 24/7 assistance. Labs were reopened when possible to assure students kept pace with technical, health career and academic requirements. In district tuition for students who worked within district boundaries but had lost jobs were allowed to continue with reduced tuition. Communication channels through a special webpage and social media kept students up to date with information about COVID-19. The college deployed 2.7 million dollars of CARES Act funding to 4,400 students each receiving $614. Students have been well served. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: Spring semester is well under way with classes offered remotely with a new opportunity for online/real time courses as an option. Once again, it is hoped that students can return for on-campus labs after March 14. The safety protocols employed on campus and self reporting of faculty and staff were effective. No campus transmission of COVID was reported. All safety measures and restricted student traffic with limited access points will continue. A new electronic self-reporting form will be implemented during spring semester. The Communications team continues to work with the COVID-19 Network of Teams to update communication channels explaining how Harper is serving students remotely. Plans are being made for summer and fall semesters depending upon guidelines and available data. Harper leadership has shown a commitment to a phased approach to returning to campus. For example, in early February, the Building M pool reopened for the Palatine Park District swim team lane training. Later in the month, community members may return to using the pool using a reservation system. After March 15, Harper will review bringing back low risk athletics and more on-campus opportunities. Q: In tough economic times, many students (and working professionals) turn to a community college for its educational value. How do you ensure that a person's financial sacrifice results in an educational benefit? A: Harper is committed to its mission of "providing quality, affordable and accessible education." Students may realize some of all of the benefits outlined here. Begin College Ready: Because of close working relationships with our K-12 partners students may complete dual credits that may shorten courses need for completion and may enroll in the Promise Program to earn two years of free tuition at Harper. Expert advising: Early on select a learning pathway, complete an educational plan and check in to stay on track. Course work: Engage with faculty committed to student success and teaching excellence. Transfer to a 4-year institution: Articulation agreements with both public and private schools makes it a relatively seamless process. Complete certificates: Certificate programs are designed in collaboration with business to match training with jobs. Financial planning: Harper is committed to keeping tuition manageable and a tuition freeze will continue through 2022. Financial assistance opportunities provided 9,700 students a total of 27 million dollars in scholarships, grants and tuition waivers in the 2018-19 academic year. College to Career: Harper transforms individual lives. Q: From the college's point of view, what budget issues will your district have to confront and what measures do you support to address them? If you believe cuts are necessary, what programs and expenses should be reduced or eliminated? On the income side, do you support any tax or fee increases? A: Over 10 years ago, through a collaboration with the entire college community, Harper set forth a financial policy to operate through sound financial policies in line with maintaining a triple AAA Bond Rating. On Feb. 10, 2021, Moody's reaffirmed this rating with a stable outlook noting the college's low reliance on state of Illinois funding and plan to close out 2021 in June with a surplus. The benefit to the community is notable as interest charged on Harper's obligations is significantly reduced with this rating. Budget cuts are not anticipated at this time. All position vacancies are carefully reviewed before being replaced and comprehensive program reviews take place on a multiyear cycle. Financial planning is done annually with a five-year projection. Enrollment is expected to be flat for the next few cycles and the impact will need to be carefully monitored. In the near term, funding from the CARES Act and the more recently passed CRRSA Act will lessen the impact of reduced tuition income. Strong fiscal stewardship is a top priority for the Harper board.

Katie Olson, a student from Libertyville High School, has been selected for the prestigious Student Enhancement in Earth and Space Science summer internship to be held at The University of Texas at Austin's Center for Space Research. Students will work with scientists and engineers to conduct authentic research from data received from NASA's Earth-observing satellites, as well as designing Mars habitats, Lunar Exploration, and analysis of images from the International Space Station. This nationally competitive program sponsored by NASA's Texas Space Grant Consortium selects students who will increase their knowledge of science, technology, engineering, and math through earth and space education. 
SEES is a collaborative effort of Texas Space Grant Consortium members and affiliates, NASA, and The University of Texas at Austin. Students apply for SEES and are selected competitively. The internships are organized around an aerospace or space science theme drawn from NASA's diverse engineering and scientific research programs. The program combines the strengths of collaborators to enrich teaching and learning of STEM. Almost 600 applications were received for the coveted 50 internship positions. Students work remotely with their project scientist before the on-site internship. During the two weeks, the students' will work at UT/CSR and conduct hands-on activities, field investigations, attend presentations by NASA scientists and engineers, and work on various NASA missions. Earth is a complex, dynamic system that is not yet fully understood. The Earth system, like the human body, comprises diverse components that interact in complex ways. NASA's Earth science program strives to understand the Earth's atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere as a single connected system. The planet is changing on all spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of the program is to develop a scientific understanding of Earth's system and its response to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards. Students selected will come together July 13-27 in Austin, Texas, to conduct experiments, tour facilities, network with other students, and conduct research while being mentored by NASA scientists and engineers at The University of Texas at Austin. The SEES internship seeks to prove that the excitement students feel about space science is a critical step in enriching science, math, engineering and technology. The internship will provide students the rare — and for most, unique — opportunity to spend two weeks working with professional scientists and engineers at the cutting-edge of space exploration. SEES is funded through NASA's Cooperative Agreement.

Eight candidates are running for four, 4-year terms on the Addison Elementary District 4 board of trustees in the April 6 election. They are incumbents Rudy Aranda, Zack Frangidakis and Jeremiah Lange, and challengers Taso Triantafillos, Eduardo Castillo Perez, Daniel Alexander Medina, Ellen M. Finizio and Christen Bollig. Finizio did not respond to the questionnaire. The Daily Herald asked each candidate about issues facing the district and how they would contribute to its progress. In-person early voting with paper ballots is now available at the DuPage County Fairgrounds Building 5, 2015 Manchester Road, Wheaton. In-person early voting with touch-screen voting begins March 22 at locations throughout the county. Learn more at www.dupageco.org/earlyvoting/. Bio Town: Addison Age: 43 Occupation: Technology administrator at a school district in Cook County Civic involvement: I have been involved in my local school PTA for the last 7 years. 
Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I have been on the board since 2017 and I am running for reelection. The issue I am most passionate about is community engagement. Now more than ever it's absolutely imperative that a school board engages effectively with the community it serves. By engaging the community we can ensure that all voices are heard and included while ensuring transparency. During my first term, I worked with the superintendent to lay the foundation for the district's first-ever Community Advisory Council. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: The board followed the science and the data from the local county health department. In addition the board surveyed parents and teachers in the fall. That information was used to formulate a plan to safely bring students back in small groups in the fall while ensuring the safety of students and staff. I think given the constantly evolving (and, at times contradictory) guidance from state and local authorities, the board did a great job given the extremely challenging situation. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: I think it's important to acknowledge here that depending on the situation all three roles are important. In March of 2020, the district had no choice but to quickly pivot to remote learning based on the governor's stay at home order. In the fall, we knew that many students were struggling with remote learning so we offered students a hybrid learning option who needed in person instruction. While this was an unpopular decision the board felt very strongly that parents should have the option of sending their students to school. Recognizing that we needed to provide continuity for students who were benefiting from remote learning, we offered parents the option of keeping their students at home. Ultimately a school board's focal responsibility is to the children it serves. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: The board collaborated with High School District 88 and elementary school districts 45 and 48 to serve breakfast and lunch at no cost for all children in the communities of Addison, Oakbrook Terrace, and Villa Park. Together with our food service companies, the four school districts have provided meals to all children since the pandemic started in March 2020, including during the summer months and school breaks. In Addison alone, we have provided nearly 200,000 meals in the past 11 months! In addition to protect the continuity of learning the district worked with every family to ensure students had adequate internet access at home to participate in remote learning. Internet hot spots were provided to those families who lacked adequate access at home. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: One of the things we learned in the fall is the challenge of teaching students in a hybrid setting. Our plan for the spring is to ensure that our teachers have the appropriate tools, training and resources to provide hybrid instruction. In addition, we are looking for ways to engage students to build relationships with them so that they feel comfortable. To address those needs the district has elected to use all of its additional remote learning planning days that were made available by the state board of education. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: Our school district is a K-8 district so this does not apply to us. Having said that as long as it is safe to do so I support allowing high school sports to continue.

During the two weeks the students' will work at UT/CSR, they will conduct hands-on activities, field investigations, attend presentations by NASA scientists and engineers, and work on various NASA missions. Earth is a complex, dynamic system we do not yet fully understand. The Earth system, like the human body, comprises diverse components that interact in complex ways. We strive to understand the Earth's atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere as a single connected system. Our planet is changing on all spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of NASA's Earth science program is to develop a scientific understanding of Earth's system and its response to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards. Students selected will come together July 13-27 in Austin, Texas to conduct experiments, tour facilities, network with other students, and conduct research while being mentored by NASA scientists and engineers at The University of Texas at Austin. The SEES internship proves that the excitement students feel about space science is a critical step in enriching science, math, engineering, and technology. The internship will provide students the rare – and for most, unique - opportunity to spend two weeks working with professional scientists and engineers at the cutting edge of space exploration. SEES is funded through NASA's Cooperative Agreement. This nationally competitive, educational training for students is sponsored by NASA's Texas Space Grant Consortium in collaboration with The University of Texas Center for Space Research and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Ten candidates are vying for four, 4-year terms on the Wheaton Warrenville Unit District 200 school board in the April 6, 2021, election. Bio City: Wheaton Age: 55 Occupation: Architect at Wight &amp; Company Civic involvement: I am nearing completion of my eighth year on the school board. I have served as board secretary, vice president, and for the past two plus years as president. Q&amp;A Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it?
 A. The survey relates only to pandemic response. The responsibility of the board is much broader. Seven board members will be seated as this school year is concluding. Any candidates running because they wanted schools open will have no impact this school year. I am seeking reelection because I know that road ahead requires experience, perspective, and deep understanding of our district. Once we get past this school year, the board will have major responsibility including contract renewals with our unions and Superintendent, prioritizing a plan to address the social-emotional wellness needs of students and staff, and bridging any learning gaps in a targeted manner as we go into next school year. We need to continue implementation of our Equity/Proactive Practices work plan and evolve our community engagement approach to help bring "healing" to the community following the disruptions and division caused by the pandemic — and exacerbated on social media. Our Portrait of a Graduate initiative needs to be completed after being paused last spring. As always, the Board must continue strong financial stewardship while staying on track with our facility improvement program. Q. How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A. I think the District has done a very good job. The Board's role is governance. We need to hear everyone, ask questions, provide feedback and speak to many different perspectives. It is impossible to be perfect in a situation that has never happened in our lifetimes. There was no road map for how to achieve this and the guidance from our state and various health departments has been frustrating. On Sept 16, the Daily Herald called District 200 "a bellwether for school reopening efforts in the pandemic." Our early childhood and elementary schools have been open five days per week from day one without a pause. Our secondary schools are back after a tough fall. We continue to create and implement ways to bring more students safely into the schools while working within the public health guidance provided to us by the medical experts. At the secondary level, we are providing four full days of instruction per week (two in person/two through livestream remote). Balancing the needs of students and the desires of teachers and parents has been a challenge. I am proud of what we have accomplished. Q. How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A. For over two years I have served as Board President. I understand the role and have personally felt the anger, frustration, and praise from community members. It has been a team effort and a good leader needs to recognize what we have achieved. My role has been to keep people together, remain focused on making sure all voices are heard, while assuring the operational decisions made by our leadership teams strike the right balance across all voices we have heard from. It is important to recognize that since this pandemic began the role of school district has expanded this year. We have played a role in assisting getting food to families in need, provided screening/testing of students and staff for COVID-19, been asked to coordinate vaccination of our teachers, and have had to become fluent in the science, data, and politics of a virus unknown barely 12 months ago. The role is not about picking sides and deciding who to listen to. It is about balancing the needs and concerns of all voices and health experts to keep moving the ball forward. That is what we have done this school year and I am proud of our team's efforts. Q. Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A. Adequate is viewed differently through the lens of each person. That is consistent through each school year. The year, we know there are people that do not feel the District has adequately served students, while others say we have done an outstanding job. I know that our peers and benchmark districts admire how we have handled this year and call us a model district. Specific examples of how we have adjusted include shifting to a livestream model at high school through a hybrid approach — allowing us to abandon the high school virtual academy. This provided curriculum consistency, but also impacted flexibility of Wednesday asynchronous day. We also altered our middle school day for second semester to model our high school's "concurrent instruction" model. We have built out an entire virtual academy with dedicated school principals and teachers. We are currently exploring the possibility of expanding the in-person elementary day but are identifying several complications. We have established new attendance policies to expand our high school in person opportunities for students that need it and will be bring some student back for four days per week of in-person instruction. Q. Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A. District 200 is already safely conducting classes and beginning to implement ways to expand our in person model in March. Based on what we have learned, we have already shifted our middle school model for the second semester and recently modified the Wednesday asynchronous day for middle school students. If there was one area I wish we could enhance it would be our asynchronous day at the high schools. However, I recognize that there are good reasons and rational for the structure of that day as an important opportunity for teachers to connect with students that have opted for the fully remote option. The fact that we maintained the virtual academy at the middle school level and did not at the high school level complicates the situation. We also added optional surveillance testing of students and staff as an enhanced mitigation strategy to assure a safe learning environment and to prevent other students being removed from in-person learning due to a close contact definitions. Q. What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A. The decision on high school sports is not a local decision. Certainly, I wish our student athletes did not have the rug pulled out from under them this fall and winter. I wish the state could have found a way. I am happy the sports season has started for our students. However, from my perspective, playing competitive sports would have also required other schools and conferences to make the same choice to play. So even if it were a local choice, competitive high school sports with other schools likely never could have happened until the IHSA acted. Equally important is the opportunity to relaunch co-curricular activities for our students. This is already underway, and more students are at the schools as a result. I think this decision also needs to be recognized as an important decision for students.

Eight candidates are vying for four seats (four-year term) in the 2021 Glen Ellyn District 41 school board race. Bio Tayyaba Syed City: Glendale Heights Age: 40 Occupation: Author/journalist, self-employed Civic involvement: Former Hadley PTA secretary, former Ben Franklin classroom mom, fundraiser for global nonprofit, youth mentor for Sisters' Steppin' Up, founded local moms' support group called the Blessed Orchard, member of Gary United Methodist Interfaith Club, volunteer for Junior Achievement Q&amp;A Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A. I'm running for the Glen Ellyn School District 41 Board of Education to help develop high quality educational services, enhance safe spaces that ensure a secure and successful learning environment, and provide diverse, equitable and inclusive schools that attract and maintain talented educators and dedicated students. 
Q. How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A. I would grade it with high marks. My family was hit with COVID-19 in early November. I informed the school as soon as we were exposed. As a parent, I greatly appreciated the preventive measures that the school took to keep everyone safe and healthy in my 1st grader's class. Even though she herself didn't get COVID, her quarantine lasted an additional 2 weeks after ours. We received regular phone calls and emails from our school nurse. Her teachers were very accommodating and simply transitioned her to remote while she was home. The saliva testing has been effective too. Everyone is dealing with this pandemic, but I strongly feel the current school board has made responsible and accurate decisions for the safety and protection of our entire community. All the while, they have maintained the opportunity for our kids to learn and grow with programs like FLES and Dual Language even with the hybrid model. That said, we can always do better and the professionals at D41 always rise to that challenge. While I am proud to celebrate our many successes, it's important to honor the challenges of families that feel efforts have fallen short and work collaboratively to resolve concerns. Q. How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A. It is our moral imperative to follow medical advice during a pandemic. We as a board would have to look at the science and data as it comes in through the World Health Organization, academic medical schools, DuPage County health guidelines, CDC and the most up to date research. As much as we want to maximize in-person learning, we must make sure to minimize any health risks. We would need to consider how many people can occupy the same space, while maintaining social distance and wearing masks. We also need to think about the students and teachers and administrations social and emotional well-being. Most importantly, how will this affect students with special or medical needs? We must take the whole community into perspective before making such a big decision. What is best for all students? It would require getting guidance from the administration and listening to parents' needs and then asking the appropriate questions. It is a process to make an informed decision as a board. Q. Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A. Yes, the district did work with B.R. Ryall YMCA and the Glen Ellyn Park District to get fees reduced during the pandemic for outside-of-school care for respective students as well as remained committed to food/meal distribution to families in need since the beginning of the pandemic. They immediately got Chromebooks to their students and conducted regular wellness checks on all students. I believe the district needs to continue to partner with its community. Q. Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A. As per the oath and position of board members, their role is to govern responsibly and do what is right for students and for the district by making sound and legally compliant decisions. I believe the hybrid model is working. I spoke with our Superintendent, who shared that due to space restraints and safety protocol, extending the day for the spring will be difficult to do. She also stated that the data is not telling us that all our kids have regressed or learning loss has occurred on a large scale. They do plan to offer summer learning programs for students. Our kids are learning, and we have stability. Q. What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A. This question does not apply to my candidacy.

While some parents have been critical, candidates running for the Hawthorn Elementary District 73 school board say they support the pace at which schools are returning to in-person learning. Four candidates are running for three, 4-year terms in the April 6 election. The only incumbent, Wesley Ann Polen, is seeking a second term. She is joined on the ballot by newcomers Michael Engle, a senior account manager with iPromo; Karl Borchers, who works in human resources for Abbott Laboratories; and Alma Miranda of Vernon Hills. 
Miranda did not respond to the Daily Herald's candidate questionnaire or participate in an editorial board endorsement meeting. In-person hybrid learning began Feb. 1 in District 73. Students who chose that option initially were in class two days a week and learning remotely the other three days. Available in-person time doubled Monday. "Throughout this entire process the board chose science not politics to drive our decisions about how and when students would return into our buildings," Polen said. "I believe our board has been very intentional and consistent about our plan," she added. "I think it's important to note we did not modify our plan when we were pressed from a very small, vocal minority." Borchers, whose oldest child will begin kindergarten in District 73 next school year, said he's been listening and learning about the variety of experiences to consider going forward. "We've leaned on the experts, we've leaned on the data and trusted science to make decisions and also empower Dr. (Superintendent Peter) Hannigan to make that call," he said. He said the hybrid model is meeting the needs of parents who want their kids in school, while balancing the needs of those who want a choice. Engle said while others pushed to open, District 73 has stayed with what was believed to be safest for students and staff. "It may not have been the most popular route but sometimes that's not the right answer," he said. "Do it safely, do it at the right time and do it for the right reasons, not just because it's a want," he added. Polen said she wants students in classrooms five days a week in fall, with a remote option available. The district has invested in technology and training, constructed a new kindergarten building and is proceeding with other building improvements. "Even in the pandemic, we're doing great things," she said. Borchers said the district's use of technology has been a benefit and service to the community. "It's been very stressful but there are things we learned," he said. "I'm very optimistic." Engle said as more students return to school, the district will need to be aware of those who may need extra accommodation or are dealing with anxiety. "I think it's going to be weird the first time you're around a group of people, even if it is in a classroom," he said. "We have to make sure we're comforting and talk about it." Engle grew up in Vernon Hills and has kids entering the school system. He says the district served him well and he wants to be involved. "It means something to me, it really does," he said. "I want to be part of that leadership, spend the time and do that with integrity." Borchers worked to pass the district's successful building referendum in 2018 and has advocated for financial considerations in the pending redevelopment agreement of Hawthorn Mall. "Taking this energy is what got me here and put me in a position where people look to me in the community (and say) ‘I know him, I trust what he does, he has our best interests in mind.'" He says he wants to "help with the issues of today and direction for tomorrow." Polen said her consistency and experience are critical to the district's success, especially as it continues to face challenges involving COVID-19 and completing the building master plan. "Knowing where we've been as a district, I believe makes it easier to see where we want to be," she said.

Oh, to have the talent to be published under a HarperCollins imprint while still in college. Glenbrook North graduate Christina Li, Class of 2017, had her middle-grade novel, "Clues to the Universe" (Quill Tree Books), published on Jan. 12. Her full-time pursuit is as a senior economics major, with a minor in data science, at Stanford University. "I've gotten wonderful responses from readers, from friends who have read it," Li said. 
"It's been really lovely. I've gotten really, really kind notes from people — from kids and parents." At 304 pages in hardcover, "Clues to the Universe" is written for students in third through seventh grade, from about 8 to 12 years old. It's a work of fiction set in 1980 that pairs young protagonists and science class partners Rosalind, or "Ro," and Benjamin, or "Benji," as they become unlikely friends. Each has a father who is absent — one due to death, the other to divorce. The young students face their grief, others' bullying, and work through their differences to find meaning and, yes, piece together clues to some of the biggest questions in the universe. As Li said, "It's about space, friendship and finding your own way in the world." Like Li, the character of Ro is Chinese American. "It was a really joyful experience to bring that experience to the page," said Li, who praised her agent, Jess Regal of Helm Literary Agency, for helping the novel see print. Written during summer breaks from school, Li wrote "Clues to the Universe" over two years before selling it in the summer of 2019. The young author said the seeds of her muse were planted long ago. Among the acknowledgments in "Clues to the Universe" is the Northbrook Public Library and "the infamous eighth grade Wood Oaks Science Fair crew." Li also sourced her own youth. "I was able to reach for that feeling of shyness I had when I was a kid," she said. She's currently working on another middle-grade book set in present-day San Francisco. Though the premise is different, Li said, the story is similar: "figuring out the world around you and growing up and dealing with all the changes." Her vantage point is unique. "There weren't a lot of books that had Asian American characters when I was growing up," Li said. "I think it's just wonderful that I get to write these books and sort of be able to contribute to children's literature in that way." ‘Revolution U' Melissa Novack, half of the Glencoe husband-and-wife team that in late 2020 launched Revolution U — a subscription-based company offering on-demand fitness classes, a healthy habits program, support groups and one-on-one coaching — has written an accompanying book. "Revolution U: change your habits, change your life" guides readers through a series of exercises designed to replace bad habits with beneficial thoughts and behaviors to create a more meaningful life. The 204-page softcover book includes a daily planner in which readers can put this knowledge into action and create their own accountability plan. Novack is a licensed clinical social worker, registered yoga teacher and also a co-founder of True Mind &amp; Body wellness center in Northbrook. Her husband and Revolution U partner Matt Friedman is an Athletics and Fitness Association of America instructor and a certified indoor cycling instructor — in addition to being an attorney. "Revolution U" is available through Amazon and on the Revolution U website, joinrevolutionu.com.

Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A.

How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A. It is our moral imperative to follow medical advice during a pandemic. We as a board would have to look at the science and data as it comes in through the World Health Organization, academic medical schools, DuPage County health guidelines, CDC and the most up to date research. As much as we want to maximize in-person learning, we must make sure to minimize any health risks. We would need to consider how many people can occupy the same space, while maintaining social distance and wearing masks. We also need to think about the students and teachers and administrations social and emotional well-being. Most importantly, how will this affect students with special or medical needs? We must take the whole community into perspective before making such a big decision. What is best for all students? It would require getting guidance from the administration and listening to parents' needs and then asking the appropriate questions. It is a process to make an informed decision as a board. Q. Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A. Yes, the district did work with B.R. Ryall YMCA and the Glen Ellyn Park District to get fees reduced during the pandemic for outside-of-school care for respective students as well as remained committed to food/meal distribution to families in need since the beginning of the pandemic. They immediately got Chromebooks to their students and conducted regular wellness checks on all students. I believe the district needs to continue to partner with its community. Q. Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A. As per the oath and position of board members, their role is to govern responsibly and do what is right for students and for the district by making sound and legally compliant decisions. I believe the hybrid model is working. I spoke with our superintendent, who shared that due to space restraints and safety protocol, extending the day for the spring will be difficult to do. She also stated that the data is not telling us that all our kids have regressed or learning loss has occurred on a large scale. They do plan to offer summer learning programs for students. Our kids are learning, and we have stability. Q. What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A. This question does not apply to my candidacy.

Five candidates are vying for four, 4-year seats on the Roselle Elementary District 12 school board in the April 6, 2021 election. They are incumbents James J. McGowan, Kimberly Duris, Christopher B. Humbert, and Steven Zurek, and newcomer David Franzen. They responded to a Daily Herald questionnaire seeking their thoughts on some of the most pressing issues facing the district. Below are McGowan's responses. In-person early voting with paper ballots begins Feb. 25 at DuPage County Fairgrounds Building 5, 2015 Manchester Road, Wheaton. In-person early voting with touch-screen voting begins March 22 at locations throughout the county. Learn more at www.dupageco.org/earlyvoting/. No candidate is slated to run for the unexpired 2-year term. 
Five candidates for four, 4-year terms Bio City: Roselle Age: 49 Occupation: Finance director at Ingredion Civic involvement: Appointed to Roselle Elementary District 12 board in May 2019, and board vice president (2020 to present); youth volunteer, coach Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I am seeking reelection to the District 12 school board to continue driving this district toward achievement of its stated mission and strategic objectives. It is imperative to continue to capitalize on the momentum created over the past few years as well as leverage continuity and experience of working through the challenges of a pandemic. As a finance professional for more than 25 years, I have a keen interest in maintaining the financial health of District 12. My current roles of vice president and finance committee member at District 12 Board of Education provide an avenue to apply my financial expertise in decision-making processes regarding fiscal matters. This has been especially important in dealing with the pandemic impacts over this school year and will be moving forward, given the state of Illinois' budgetary issues. In addition to financial stewardship of community funding, the district has an exciting agenda made up of curriculum expansion and facility upgrades in support of District 12's mission of keeping students and their academic pursuits at the center of all decisions. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: District 12 school board has had a favorable response to the pandemic. The student population was converted to a full remote learning program in less than two weeks last spring as the pandemic hit our community. Next, a planning committee inclusive of our superintendent, both principals, social workers, nurses and teacher representatives was created to adequately plan a path to in-person learning in August 2020. Guided by data, science and advisement of local health organizations rigorous safety and sanitization protocols were established to protect students, families, teachers and support staff. Throughout the summer, in partnership with the district administration, teachers and families considered many learning models and ultimately a five-day dedicated in-person and a five-day dedicated remote instruction model were offered to keep student progression moving forward. As the year began, teacher devices were upgraded to meet the higher demands of remote learning. District 12 continues to offer both learning models today and through these careful considerations and decisions, we feel the learning loss of students has been minimized. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: The pandemic has clearly impacted district families, students and teachers in a variety of ways. The board, as well as the district administration, provided opportunities for community engagement and feedback regarding the overall response to pandemic impacts. All have been focused on an attempt to establish flexibility with learning models keeping the student's safety and academic progress at the forefront. I view my specific role as listening to members of the community, understanding their perspectives and taking them into account when engaging with my fellow board members to stay true to the district's mission for students as well as the safety protocols in accordance with health experts guidance. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I believe District 12 did continue to adequately serve students throughout the pandemic. This was accomplished via the in-person and remote learning models to address different family situations across both schools. Further, as more students expressed interest in transitioning to in-person learning in second term, alternative spacing decisions were made along with staffing adjustments. Each family in the district was ultimately able to receive their first choice in learning model for both the fall 2020 and spring 2021 term. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: District 12 will continue to offer an in-person model and remote model to address different family desires for student learning this spring. The success of the fall term has resulted in more students moving to in-person learning and the district has been able to accommodate through creative problem-solving regarding space. I believe one of the most important learnings for our district is the benefit of increased engagement from District 12's families. Listening to their ideas, opinions and suggestions has assisted in setting a path to academic progress for students while keeping their health and safety prioritized. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: In accordance with health experts' recommendations, I am supportive of high school sports continuing during the pandemic. Strict adherence to mask wearing, social distancing, and other safety protocols must be followed as laid out by health officials, but I have seen the health and wellness benefits for kids safely participating in athletics during this difficult time.

Argonne National Laboratory researcher Prasanna Balaprakash will discuss artificial intelligence's impact on the development of advanced technologies at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, in the Jack Turner Conference Center, Student Resource Center Room 2000, at the College of DuPage, 425 Fawell Blvd. in Glen Ellyn. This free event is part of the college's STEMinar series. 
A computer scientist in Argonne's Mathematics and Computer Science Division, with a joint appointment in the Leadership Computing Facility, Balaprakash leads the machine-learning team and co-leads the data-understanding team in the Institute for Resource and Application Productivity through computation, Information and Data Science (RAPIDS) at the laboratory. Based on his work in the lab, Balaprakash said that artificial intelligence and machine learning are fundamentally changing the way scientists do research, as well as our understanding of the world. "In traditional problem solving, we think about the problem and figure out how to solve it," he said. "Similarly, in traditional computing, we have to tell the computer how to solve a problem. When we run into complicated problems that we can't find a solution for, we can be at a loss. With AI, we don't do that. We just give the computer examples through data and the computer learns how to solve the problem." That being said, Balaprakash added that artificial intelligence has potential to greatly benefit humankind. "As computing power becomes cheaper and we continue to generate more and more data, machine learning and artificial intelligence provide unprecedented opportunities to solve problems and create beneficial technologies or treatment plans for diseases like cancer or Alzheimer's." Balaprakash earned his bachelor's degree in computer science engineering from the Periyar University in Salem, India, and his master's degree in computer science from the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg in Germany. He received his Ph.D. in engineering sciences from CoDE-IRIDIA, Université libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium, where he received Marie Curie and F.R.S-FNRS Aspirant fellowships. A recipient of the U.S. Department of Energy 2018 Early Career Award, Balaprakash is a Fellow in the Northwestern-Argonne Institute of Science and Engineering at Northwestern University and holds a Scientist At-Large appointment in the University of Chicago Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering. Seating for his event is limited. Registration is required at www.cod.edu/academics/academic_opportunities/stem/. The STEMinar Series at College of DuPage consists of free talks covering a variety of topics related to science, technology, engineering and math throughout the fall and spring semesters. The goal of STEM at COD is to enhance the quality of STEM instructional and outreach programs and to help current and future students prepare for careers in STEM fields. It offers a broad range of academic programs designed to provide students with the educational background and training needed to successfully pursue an advanced degree or career in STEM.

Four candidates seek the three seats on the Hawthorn District 73 school board in the April 6, 2021 election. Bio City: Vernon Hills Age: 41 Occupation: COO Civic involvement: Hawthorn School of Dual Language parent volunteer, Hawthorn PTO volunteer, Vernon Hills Park District basketball coach, Girl Scouts parent volunteer Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I believe ALL Hawthorn students should receive a high-quality education from top-notch educators, regardless of their abilities or background. 
I am running for reelection because I feel consistency and experience on the Board are critical to the district's success, especially as we continue to deal with the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and complete our Educational Facilities Master Plan. Hawthorn's success ultimately depends upon the relationship between the superintendent and the school board. I am fortunate for the opportunity to work with such a talented and dedicated team as we support Dr. Hannigan as he navigates the many obstacles involved in transforming Hawthorn. I am proud of what we have accomplished, but we have only just begun. I would love to continue serving the district and the Hawthorn community during this exciting and challenging time. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I would give a grade of 90% for our response to the pandemic. From day one, keeping Hawthorn students, staff, and families safe has been our number one priority. Throughout this entire process, our Board chose science, not politics, to drive our decisions about how and when students would return to our buildings. Our return to in-person learning was based on local public health data and conditions, and district-specific information. Our Board has been transparent, consistent, and most importantly, we did not modify our plan when pressured by a very small vocal minority. Given the diverse makeup of our student population, Dr. Hannigan and his team focused on equitable access to learning for all students. Hawthorn provided 1:1 devices to all students and connectivity to the families who did not have access. Teachers and staff received training on how to deliver remote instruction. Resources were provided to parents and guardians to help and support their student(s) navigate the remote learning platform and remote instruction. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: During the pandemic, my role is similar to my role on any topic and includes all three of the components mentioned in the question. I work with my fellow Board members to provide leadership to our District. We support the Superintendent's recommendations when they make sense in the circumstances and align with our goals. Our decisions are not always popular, but our goal is always to make the best decision to benefit as many of our students and other stakeholders as possible. We gathered feedback from our constituents through surveys, emails sent to the Board, and public comments made during the open meetings. Some agreed with us, and some did not. Although feedback is not always determinative of the outcome or decision, it is still considered a puzzle piece. Illinois tends to leave many decisions to local control, but the Board does defer to the State or higher governing authorities on many topics, including this one, when necessary. Q: Did your school district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: Yes, and we are continually reassessing to make continuous improvements. The Hawthorn teachers, staff, and administrators have gone above and beyond during the pandemic to serve our students' needs. By delaying the start of our hybrid reopening model, Hawthorn took advantage of the remote learning platform to better serve our students. The focus on remote learning provided our students with a consistent schedule, a more rigorous curriculum, common assessments, and unified communication. Additionally, having all students using the remote learning platform created a more equitable learning experience. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: The Board's responsibility is to govern, not create or implement plans for the District. That said, I will continue to support our in-person hybrid model rollout, which began on February 1. If Dr. Hannigan finds ways to provide more in-person learning opportunities for our students using the local public health data and conditions, guidance from the Illinois Department of Public Health, and legal advice, I will support it. This fall, I learned that making the right decision is not always popular, but that does not mean it is wrong. Consistency is key to the success of our students, and our remote learning platform allowed for that. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: I believe in following the science and the data. This decision should be made by the infectious disease experts, medical professionals, and the professionals who oversee the sports programs. If the experts all agree and say sports can continue safely then sports should be played.

Don't sell my data! We finally have a law for that, but it's not easy to get it done

With apologies to the Beastie Boys: You gotta fight for your right to privacy. America's first broad data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act, went into effect Jan. 1. These days, a wild range of companies gather and sell your data, from Ford and Chipotle to Uber and Walmart. Now the CCPA gives you the power to say cut it out. And while the law technically covers only California residents, Americans living anywhere can use the CCPA to reset their relationships with more than a dozen major businesses (and counting). Just know that some companies are going to make you jump through hoops. 
I've been learning how to use the law by filing requests to more than 100 companies. To be covered by the CCPA, companies have to make more than $25 million per year or collect data on more than 50,000 people. They're not incentivized to make it easy: Amazon hid critical links in legal gobbledygook. Marketing data company LiveRamp asked me to submit a selfie holding my own ID, kidnap-victim style. Walmart asked for my astrological sign to confirm my identity. (Really.) And one business left me a voice mail, but the message included no return number ... or even the name of the company. (Please call back!) Yet I've also been pleasantly surprised: Some of the biggest businesses, including Netflix, Microsoft, Starbucks and UPS, are extending CCPA rights to all Americans rather than just Californians. That makes some sense: It's additional work for companies to try to confirm where people live. And frankly, it's not a good look for them to claim they care about customer privacy and then discriminate against Americans who don't live in California. Many of these companies tell me they'll participate when Congress passes a federal data privacy law, which they know isn't likely anytime soon. Privacy advocates have mixed feelings about the CCPA. It's true that it creates too much work for many people - and everyone deserves privacy, even if they're not willing to jump through hoops. But I'm in the camp that thinks the CCPA is an important step forward. I spent the past year following the secret life of the data on my phone, car and credit cards, often confronting a stone wall from companies. Now we all have the legal authority to demand answers about what's happening with our data. For example, the CCPA has already revealed that Amazon keeps a record of everything you do on a Kindle, from when you start and stop reading to when you highlight a word. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, but I review all tech with the same critical eye.) The CCPA is far from a perfect privacy law, but it's the one America has in 2020. Q: What does the CCPA do? A: On its own, the CCPA won't do much for your privacy. But if you take some action, it gives you three useful rights: 1) You can ask companies to show you exactly what data they've collected about you. 2) You can instruct companies not to "sell" your data. The word "sell" is in quotes because the law defines that pretty broadly as an exchange of value. 3) You can ask companies to delete your data, unless doing so would create a security threat or interfere with someone else's free speech. Even better, the law says companies are not allowed to treat you differently or charge you money just for exercising your data rights. There's also a special restriction for children: If you're under 16, a company needs you to explicitly opt in before they can sell your information. Q: How much work is this? A: You have to go to each and every company to exercise your CCPA rights. Yes, that could become a never-ending project. But the good news is that many companies have web forms you can fill out like busywork. I submitted about a hundred in less time than it took me to binge the most recent season of "The Crown." So far there's no tool to help you do this all at once or service that will manage your data for you, though I've heard from several start-ups working on that. Keep in mind that some online services, including Facebook, say a "delete" request involves totally shutting your account, rather than just pressing a reset button on all the unwelcome surveillance of your life. Q: What hoops might companies make me jump through? A: Before you dive into making requests, get organized. You'll need to have access to your usernames, passwords and loyalty card numbers. (If you don't already have a password manager to keep all your important information organized, this is an excellent time to get one.) Companies can ask you to prove your identity, and if there are errors or missing information they can reject your request. Scan or photograph your driver's license; many sites required me to upload it, or a version that was redacted. Data firm Wiland even asked me for a notarized letter. Some companies will try to shift work onto you. Airbnb and PayPal, among others, make you email them requests, rather than using web forms. Instead of a simple "do not sell" switch, companies including Mastercard make you manage a series of privacy "preferences." To opt out, Best Buy says you have to change your web browser to block all cookies (breaking some sites) and dig into your phone settings to turn off some advertising tracking. Don't let any of this stop you from demanding your rights. The most common annoyance is firms hiding their CCPA instructions behind many links and impenetrable privacy policies. Q: Is there any information that isn't covered? A: Companies don't have to share information that's already public, that they've collected in a job interview or that they've aggregated in ways that don't identify you. Some companies have come up short in what they actually disclose. For example, in CCPA requests it returned to me, Amazon has yet to share what data it collects in its camera-equipped Amazon Go convenience stores. And businesses already covered by a few existing privacy laws are exempt - even if those laws don't require transparency like the CCPA. That means banks and doctor's offices generally don't have to abide. Q: What counts as data ‘sale'? A: This is one of the most-debated questions in tech right now. The CCPA says selling data is a transfer of information for commercial purposes. That's obvious where one company pays another for, say, your burrito purchase history. But many businesses, particularly ones involved in online advertising, pass along information in other ways, such as tracker cookies and pixels hidden on websites and apps. Some of the biggest firms, including Facebook, Amazon and Google, contend the "do not sell" request part of the CCPA doesn't apply to them because they don't sell our data. They just make billions off our data by using it to target ads and train artificial intelligence software. Others are claiming an out because the law is too vague. For example, Spotify's privacy policy says it shares your personal information with advertisers - but the music service doesn't think that should count as a sale. "It is currently unclear whether the use of certain types of advertising partners would be considered a sale under CCPA," the company says. The authors of the CCPA say they intended the term "sale" to reflect the wider data economy. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra hasn't yet published guidelines for how his office will interpret the law, and we might not get firm answers until his office begins enforcing it. That's set to begin July 1. Q: Once I have my data, what do I do with it? A: First, keep it secure by storing it only on a computer you control with a password. Most of the data requests I've received so far have come in formats I can easily read, such as text files or PDFs. But not all: Twitter sent me files in a .js format that requires a data science degree to understand. (The company says it is working to improve that.) I'm still waiting to hear back on most of my requests; the law gives companies up to 90 days to deliver. But already I learned that WiFi router maker Eero, owned by Amazon, keeps a detailed log of every device that's ever connected to my network. (It's like a creepy visitor guest book.) Fandango not only tallied all the movies I've watched but also concluded I have an affinity for the Muppets. (True.) When you examine your data, keep an eye out for information you didn't know the company had - or don't think it should. If you don't like what you see, submit a CCPA delete request. Or stop doing business with the company, and be sure to tell it why.

Where others see numbers and coding, Kyle Ockerlund sees hope for changing the world one program at a time.
The Huntley High School senior was among 10 Illinois high school students to receive the 2015 Fifty for the Future Award from the Illinois Technology Foundation earlier this year. The program, in its ninth year, recognized the top 60 Illinois technology students, including 50 college students and 10 high school students statewide.
Ockerlund has written two books on computer programming — "Jumpstart Ti Basic" and "Jumpstart Z80 Machine Code," both how-to guides for using programming languages with Texas Instruments graphing calculators — available through Amazon. He gained national attention for research the Experimental Science Society — which he helped found — completed on the effect school bell tone has on student concentration.
His research found a 10 percent decrease in concentration during tests among students exposed to the school's new higher-pitched bell sound compared to students exposed to the previous lower-pitched bell. After presenting his research to administrators, the bell tone was changed back to the low-pitch ring.
Since then, Ockerlund has been involved in other research studies, including a memory lab project examining how students memorize and retain information, more specifically languages.
"The goal is just to get a better understanding of how these things work so the whole process could be optimized for students learning languages," said Ockerlund, 17, of Lake in the Hills.
For two years, Ockerlund has undertaken an independent study in data science where he creates his own curriculum and teaches it to himself using online resources under the guidance of Huntley High computer science teacher Michelle Zietlow, who nominated him for the technology award.
"Last year, I built programs and trained an artificial neural network," he said. "It learned how to play tic-tac-toe all on its own."
Another project involves creating a routing program being used on a trial basis by the Cook County sheriff's office.
"It takes in addresses and creates a travel plan. That program is being used right now in order for them serving various papers and court orders," he said. "The plan is to eventually release it to the county and maybe other counties."
Zietlow said she is amazed by Ockerlund's creativity and motivation to learn about technology, which sets him apart from his peers.
"His understanding of machine learning is way beyond what I understand," she said. "He is just so ambitious and he picks up the material so quickly."
After graduating in May, Ockerlund aims to study data science, data mining and processing, and statistics.
"I could see myself working for a bank to make predictions on loan stability ... working for a hospital identifying cancerous cells in x-ray images," he said.

The Pydata March Meetup was hosted by Daniel Little and Ji Dong and sponsored by Allstate. MacLeod and Wigell presented first followed by Itay Livni who presented on software for educational vocabulary. 
After each presentation, the audience members were given time to ask questions and share their own insights followed by a meet and greet at the end of the meetup. After the presentation, Livni joined the SCF team as a Consultant. Wigell stated, "With his experience, he will be a great addition to the team." Wigell credits the Pydata Meetup for introducing Livni to SCF. MacLeod and Wigell have created a predictive order technology for CPG wholesalers that predicts what products will be ordered by a salesperson for beverage wholesalers in a large format grocery store. They are working with an obfuscated transactional data set from a major CPG beverage wholesaler. During their presentation they discussed how they made their choices, the issues they ran into, presenting historical vs. predicted data visually, and how they are solving problems by using Tableau data visualizations. They provided key insights into how this technology can benefit CPG wholesalers and what effects this could have on time and revenue. Together, MacLeod and Wigell have spent 30+ years working with IT, analytics, data science, and data visualization. While the case presented applied SCF's predictive order technology to beverage distribution, the predictive order technology is available to the consumer packaged goods industry.

Bio City: Vernon Hills Age: 41 Occupation: COO Civic involvement: Hawthorn School of Dual Language parent volunteer, Hawthorn PTO volunteer, Vernon Hills Park District basketball coach, Girl Scouts parent volunteer Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I believe ALL Hawthorn students should receive a high-quality education from top-notch educators, regardless of their abilities or background. I am running for reelection because I feel consistency and experience on the Board are critical to the district's success, especially as we continue to deal with the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and complete our Educational Facilities Master Plan. 
Hawthorn's success ultimately depends upon the relationship between the superintendent and the school board. I am fortunate for the opportunity to work with such a talented and dedicated team as we support Dr. Hannigan as he navigates the many obstacles involved in transforming Hawthorn. I am proud of what we have accomplished, but we have only just begun. I would love to continue serving the district and the Hawthorn community during this exciting and challenging time. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I would give a grade of 90% for our response to the pandemic. From day one, keeping Hawthorn students, staff, and families safe has been our number one priority. Throughout this entire process, our board chose science, not politics, to drive our decisions about how and when students would return to our buildings. Our return to in-person learning was based on local public health data and conditions, and district-specific information. Our Board has been transparent, consistent, and, most importantly, we did not modify our plan when pressured by a very small vocal minority. Given the diverse makeup of our student population, Dr. Hannigan and his team focused on equitable access to learning for all students. Hawthorn provided 1:1 devices to all students and connectivity to the families who did not have access. Teachers and staff received training on how to deliver remote instruction. Resources were provided to parents and guardians to help and support their student(s) navigate the remote learning platform and remote instruction. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: During the pandemic, my role is similar to my role on any topic and includes all three of the components mentioned in the question. I work with my fellow Board members to provide leadership to our District. We support the Superintendent's recommendations when they make sense in the circumstances and align with our goals. Our decisions are not always popular, but our goal is always to make the best decision to benefit as many of our students and other stakeholders as possible. We gathered feedback from our constituents through surveys, emails sent to the Board, and public comments made during the open meetings. Some agreed with us, and some did not. Although feedback is not always determinative of the outcome or decision, it is still considered a puzzle piece. Illinois tends to leave many decisions to local control, but the Board does defer to the State or higher governing authorities on many topics, including this one, when necessary. Q: Did your school district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: Yes, and we are continually reassessing to make continuous improvements. The Hawthorn teachers, staff, and administrators have gone above and beyond during the pandemic to serve our students' needs. By delaying the start of our hybrid reopening model, Hawthorn took advantage of the remote learning platform to better serve our students. The focus on remote learning provided our students with a consistent schedule, a more rigorous curriculum, common assessments, and unified communication. Additionally, having all students using the remote learning platform created a more equitable learning experience. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: The Board's responsibility is to govern, not create or implement plans for the District. That said, I will continue to support our in-person hybrid model rollout, which began on February 1. If Dr. Hannigan finds ways to provide more in-person learning opportunities for our students using the local public health data and conditions, guidance from the Illinois Department of Public Health, and legal advice, I will support it. This fall, I learned that making the right decision is not always popular, but that does not mean it is wrong. Consistency is key to the success of our students, and our remote learning platform allowed for that. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: I believe in following the science and the data. This decision should be made by the infectious disease experts, medical professionals, and the professionals who oversee the sports programs. If the experts all agree and say sports can continue safely then sports should be played.

Panel: First vaccines to health staffs Vaccines: Some want more data on residents of nursing homes

The first doses of a coronavirus vaccine should be given to an estimated 21 million health care workers and 3 million residents and staffers of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, a federal advisory panel recommended Tuesday afternoon. These groups were deemed the highest priority by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices because the vaccine will initially be in extremely short supply after it is cleared by federal regulators. Health care personnel are a top priority because of their exposure to the virus and their critical role in keeping the nation's hospitals and clinics functioning. Residents and employees of long-term care facilities were prioritized because they account for nearly 40% of deaths linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
The recommendations for the highest priority groups, known as phase 1a, will be sent to CDC Director Robert Redfield, who also informs Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. If the recommendations are approved, they will become official CDC recommendations on immunization in the United States and provide official guidance to state officials, who are working to meet a Friday deadline for vaccine-distribution planning. The committee voted 13 to 1 to prioritize the two groups. Helen Keipp Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University, was the sole dissenting vote. Unease over the recommendations centered on the inclusion of long-term-care residents, with several panel members saying there was insufficient vaccine safety and efficacy data to support immunizing that population right away. Talbot said safety monitoring of people who have gotten the shots in these settings is inadequate. "We hope it works, and we hope it's safe," she said of the vaccine. Other members said they were reassured by the support of the recommendation from geriatric medicine specialists. Beth Bell, a global health expert at the University of Washington who chairs the panel's coronavirus vaccine work group, said the vote was coming at "a particularly difficult time" in the pandemic. "There is an average of one COVID death per minute right now," she said. During the three-hour meeting, she said, 180 people "will have died from COVID-19, so we are acting none too soon." The advisory group will make recommendations at later meetings for priority groups in the next phases, which include essential workers and older adults. A union representing 1.3 million food and retail workers — the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union — urged the CDC on Tuesday evening to prioritize workers in grocery, meatpacking and food processing for the next round, citing the thousands who have already died. What the committee will recommend may differ from what some Trump administration officials want, according to three federal health officials. Redfield; Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force; and Adm. Brett Giroir, the top testing official at the Department of Health and Human Services, have recently emphasized the importance of prioritizing older Americans, whereas the committee members have held firm on giving preference to health care workers. Michael Pratt, an HHS spokesman, said Azar is committed to following the process and "has insisted that science and data drive the process for vaccines and therapeutic development, and will do so for vaccine allocation and distribution." He added: "Doctors will make their recommendations, and ultimately the governors will make a determination of what works best for their communities based on input they receive and the circumstances on the ground." U.S. officials anticipate having about 40 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer and biotech firm Moderna by the end of the year, enough to immunize 20 million people, a fraction of the U.S. population of 330 million. Operation Warp Speed, the administration's initiative to speed vaccine and therapeutics development, plans to send the first batch of 6.4 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine to communities nationwide within 24 hours of FDA clearance, with the expectation that shots will be administered quickly. But because of the limited doses, the panel's work group suggested that health care systems prioritize their personnel even further. They might do that by staggering vaccinations by individual units — such as emergency departments — and giving vaccine first to those with direct patient contact and those who handle infectious material, and to personnel who provide services to patients or their families. CDC officials said they anticipate that most of the estimated 40 million doses will be distributed by the end of December. After that, 5 million to 10 million doses of vaccine are expected to be sent out each week. Nancy Messonnier, the top official overseeing distribution at CDC, said her talks with states and local officials suggest that most intend to vaccinate all their health care workers within three weeks of getting vaccine.

Pandemic sparks Glenbrook South grad to cook up Memory Meals initiative

Chris Tang has taken the term homework to a happy extreme. During his time at Glenbrook South High School, Tang was a member of the school's service-oriented activities, Interact and Key Club, but "never really a leader," he said. "I just participated now and then," he said. 
Since graduating, though, he's kicked his service commitment into overdrive with an initiative he calls "Memory Meals," sparked by the COVID-19 crisis. He's invited people to create packaged breakfasts and drop them off at his house or to pledge money he'll use to make meals for distribution to social service agencies. In a document he sent to fellow members of Glenbrook South's Class of 2020, Tang noted that a breakfast costs all of $1.50 to create. The "meals" part is obvious; "memory" relates to the positive feeling of helping others — "creating this memory for themselves and making a difference," he said. "I think just having all that time in quarantine and hearing all those stories about the struggles people are having, it just felt right, I guess, to create Memory Meals and to support them," Tang said. The Memory Meals effort last month targeted Housing Forward, a Maywood-based nonprofit. Its mission is to transition people in 21 west Cook County communities from "housing crisis to housing stability," according to its website. Tang, with his brothers Ivan and Nathan, has dropped off a week's worth of bagged meals there each Saturday for the past month. This month and in August, his service shifts to Rogers Park. He will be working with the faith-based UR Chicago Alliance and is exploring relationships with other organizations such as the Howard Area Community Center. As of June 29, Memory Meals had packed and donated more than 800 meals. Tang's goal over the summer is 2,020, in honor of Glenbrook South's Class of 2020. "I'd like to thank those that donated to Memory Meals, because their generosity is much appreciated by those who've received it," he said. To participate in Memory Meals, Tang asks people to contact him through email at ctang500@gmail.com or by sending a text message to (847) 736-9456. A Titans boys tennis co-captain whose senior season was canceled by COVID-19, Tang hopes to continue playing club or intramural tennis at Purdue University, where he plans to study computer science and data science. His departure to West Lafayette may not be the end of Memory Meals. "Once I leave I might pitch it to some of the clubs at Glenbrook South, like Interact or Key Club," Tang said. "Just giving it legs to new people and seeing if they want to continue. Nothing's set in stone yet, but I would definitely like for it to become a normal thing, where we continue to support those who need it."

FACEBOOK UNDER FIRE ‘Next level' of fake news Data: Trump campaign denied using firm's info

NEW YORK — Facebook "likes" can tell a lot about a person. Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of — and which Facebook may have enabled. The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections. Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 percent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain's information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica's servers because the British firm had been "uncooperative" in her investigation. 
The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it "stood down" that effort at the request of British officials. Adding to the turmoil, The New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August after clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet, Stamos said he's still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed. It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence. Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm "took fake news to the next level." "This is based on an idea called ‘informational dominance,' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening," Wylie said Monday on NBC's "Today." It's not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that. Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research — not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked — even though those friends hadn't downloaded the app or given explicit consent. Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku. Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer and at one point employed Stephen Bannon — later President Donald Trump's campaign chairman and White House adviser — as a vice president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million, according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work. The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person's viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch. But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it's connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media. Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to "explore mental vulnerabilities of people." He said the firm "works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites, etc., that make them think things are happening that may not be." Wylie told "Today" that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views. The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge's data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing and says it didn't retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn't use it in its 2016 campaign work. Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016. Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red-light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red-light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use. Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime. Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook's mapping of the "social graph" — essentially the web of people's real-life connections — is also invaluable for marketers. For example, researchers can look at people's clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.

Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: Because I have seen firsthand the struggles that remote learning has caused students, parents and teachers alike. I see it as on my students' faces as they laboriously go from Google Meet to Google Meet, in parents' voices as we converse in the neighborhood, and in my own daughter, as she and her friends are doing OK. They have lost out, in my opinion on a great amount of learning, as remote learning is neither active nor is it typically engaging or challenging academically. I have to ask why we're settling for "OK?" I am also running to be a listening ear to all D87 stakeholders, and to respond efficiently and transparently to their needs. I will strive to maintain a safe, full-time return to learning (as the science shows is possible as well as neighboring private schools), as well as enhancing remote learning for those who choose. As a special education and EL teacher, I am committed to finding and implementing strategies to bring about equity to all unserved and underserved students in order that they will all get the best education possible, and so that they can each find success. I am committed to maintaining fiscal integrity for all taxpayers so that Glenbard D87 can continue to hire excellent teachers and offer stellar learning opportunities to its students. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I would grade this response a C-. I feel as if the school board has more than fulfilled its obligations to students and staff by purchasing all of the mitigation products and PPE required items according to ISBE and IDPH. They have also surpassed their requirements by making saliva testing mandatory, adding thermal temperature scanners, etc. On the other hand, I also feel that the current board has not had a plan to get kids back in school, even though much science supports students going back to school. There also never seems to be a plan B (livestreaming, 4 day hybrid, senior planning) until parents bring this up at board meetings. The current board has also not been fully transparent in its endeavors and there seems to be a lot of infighting and "hushing" of differing opinions. How can we expect our students and teachers to embrace others opinions, when our school board appears not to? Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: I view my role as imperative to getting students back in school for those who want this option. If we follow the COVID data trends and science, this will show us that it is safe for students to be in school full time, following protocols. Many schools around us are already in this full-time scenario. Local and regional science should be followed. Those who choose remote should look forward to an enhanced version of this, as studies also show many students are falling behind rapidly in their academics, with minority students losing strides at a faster rate than others. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I believe that my current district thought they were doing a great job, thought they were speaking for the stakeholders, when in actuality, they were not. I have attended nearly every board meeting this school year, and way back in September (when COVID positivity was relatively low and private schools were in session) parents were asking for hybrid learning as students were struggling. Those pleas fell on deaf ears. The board claimed that the fall learning was better than the spring, but could give no specific reasons why. By the time they came around to offering hybrid, the numbers were climbing and we only got three weeks of in-person learning. In the end, we could have planned for more than one scenario and had the students in class for a much more robust period of time. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: Yes. We all know that a lot can change over the course of the next 6 months, but in my opinion, school can and should open full time for those who opt for in person learning. Glenbard D87 has spent millions of dollars on mitigations and saliva testing (which results so far show that our schools can be open safely). We should call upon our private schools sectors for any information we do not already have and work with local health authorities to finalize the plan. We are saliva testing, have ample janitorial staff and according to the most recent (January 2021) board meeting, people have finally been brought in to assess how many students can actually be in a classroom at 6-foot distances. I would definitely get kids in school (those who choose in person learning) more, as science shows it is safe to do so. I would also focus more on best practices such as keeping learning active, giving timely feedback and valuing all input. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: High school sports should absolutely continue. Not only should they continue, but when able spectators should be allowed, especially in outdoor venues. Collegiate and professional sports are continuing, as are high school sports in surrounding states and conferences. With proper mitigations, all sports should be played and enjoyed. Many students count on sports as a means to offsetting college expenses, and others need them for mental health, sociability and stability efforts.

Bio Town: Lombard Age: 49 Occupation: Teacher, special ed and ESL, Cicero School District 99 Civic involvement: I foster dogs through Little Giants Rescue in Lombard. Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: Because I have seen firsthand the struggles that remote learning has caused students, parents and teachers alike. 
I see it as on my students' faces as they laboriously go from Google Meet to Google Meet, in parents' voices as we converse in the neighborhood, and in my own daughter, as she and her friends are doing OK. They have lost out, in my opinion on a great amount of learning, as remote learning is neither active nor is it typically engaging or challenging academically. I have to ask why we're settling for "OK?" I am also running to be a listening ear to all D87 stakeholders, and to respond efficiently and transparently to their needs. I will strive to maintain a safe, full-time return to learning (as the science shows is possible as well as neighboring private schools), as well as enhancing remote learning for those who choose. As a special education and EL teacher, I am committed to finding and implementing strategies to bring about equity to all unserved and underserved students in order that they will all get the best education possible, and so that they can each find success. I am committed to maintaining fiscal integrity for all taxpayers so that Glenbard D87 can continue to hire excellent teachers and offer stellar learning opportunities to its students. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: I would grade this response a C-. I feel as if the school board has more than fulfilled its obligations to students and staff by purchasing all of the mitigation products and PPE required items according to ISBE and IDPH. They have also surpassed their requirements by making saliva testing mandatory, adding thermal temperature scanners, etc. On the other hand, I also feel that the current board has not had a plan to get kids back in school, even though much science supports students going back to school. There also never seems to be a plan B (livestreaming, 4 day hybrid, senior planning) until parents bring this up at board meetings. The current board has also not been fully transparent in its endeavors and there seems to be a lot of infighting and "hushing" of differing opinions. How can we expect our students and teachers to embrace others opinions, when our school board appears not to? Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: I view my role as imperative to getting students back in school for those who want this option. If we follow the COVID data trends and science, this will show us that it is safe for students to be in school full time, following protocols. Many schools around us are already in this full-time scenario. Local and regional science should be followed. Those who choose remote should look forward to an enhanced version of this, as studies also show many students are falling behind rapidly in their academics, with minority students losing strides at a faster rate than others. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I believe that my current district thought they were doing a great job, thought they were speaking for the stakeholders, when in actuality, they were not. I have attended nearly every board meeting this school year, and way back in September (when COVID positivity was relatively low and private schools were in session) parents were asking for hybrid learning as students were struggling. Those pleas fell on deaf ears. The board claimed that the fall learning was better than the spring, but could give no specific reasons why. By the time they came around to offering hybrid, the numbers were climbing and we only got three weeks of in-person learning. In the end, we could have planned for more than one scenario and had the students in class for a much more robust period of time. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: Yes. We all know that a lot can change over the course of the next 6 months, but in my opinion, school can and should open full time for those who opt for in person learning. Glenbard D87 has spent millions of dollars on mitigations and saliva testing (which results so far show that our schools can be open safely). We should call upon our private schools sectors for any information we do not already have and work with local health authorities to finalize the plan. We are saliva testing, have ample janitorial staff and according to the most recent (January 2021) board meeting, people have finally been brought in to assess how many students can actually be in a classroom at 6-foot distances. I would definitely get kids in school (those who choose in person learning) more, as science shows it is safe to do so.

Don't sell my data! We finally have a law for that

With apologies to the Beastie Boys: You gotta fight for your right to privacy. America's first broad data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act, went into effect Jan. 1. These days, a wild range of companies gather and sell your data, from Ford and Chipotle to Uber and Walmart. Now the CCPA gives you the power to say cut it out. And while the law technically covers only California residents, Americans living anywhere can use the CCPA to reset their relationships with more than a dozen major businesses (and counting). Just know that some companies are going to make you jump through hoops. 
To help, I'm breaking the CCPA down into bites. I've been learning how to use the law by filing requests to more than 100 companies. To be covered by the CCPA, companies have to make more than $25 million per year or collect data on more than 50,000 people. They're not incentivized to make it easy: Amazon hid critical links in legal gobbledygook. Marketing data company LiveRamp asked me to submit a selfie holding my own ID, kidnap-victim style. Walmart asked for my astrological sign to confirm my identity. (Really.) And one business left me a voice mail, but the message included no return number ... or even the name of the company. (Please call back!) Yet I've also been pleasantly surprised: Some of the biggest businesses, including Netflix, Microsoft, Starbucks and UPS, are extending CCPA rights to all Americans rather than just Californians. That makes some sense: It's additional work for companies to try to confirm where people live. And frankly, it's not a good look for them to claim they care about customer privacy and then discriminate against Americans who don't live in California. Many of these companies tell me they'll participate when Congress passes a federal data privacy law, which they know isn't likely anytime soon. Privacy advocates have mixed feelings about the CCPA. It's true that it creates too much work for many people — and everyone deserves privacy, even if they're not willing to jump through hoops. But I'm in the camp that thinks the CCPA is an important step forward. I spent the past year following the secret life of the data on my phone, car and credit cards, often confronting a stone wall from companies. Now we all have the legal authority to demand answers about what's happening with our data. For example, the CCPA has already revealed that Amazon keeps a record of everything you do on a Kindle, from when you start and stop reading to when you highlight a word. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, but I review all tech with the same critical eye.) The CCPA is far from a perfect privacy law, but it's the one America has in 2020. I want to hear what you discover using it. I'm hopeful it will fuel an overdue public conversation about what kind of surveillance is OK — and what crosses the line. Q: What does the CCPA do? A: On its own, the CCPA won't do much for your privacy. But if you take some action, it gives you three useful rights: 1) You can ask companies to show you exactly what data they've collected about you. 2) You can instruct companies not to "sell" your data. The word "sell" is in quotes because the law defines that pretty broadly as an exchange of value. (There's a lot of debate about that, though — see below.) 3) You can ask companies to delete your data, unless doing so would create a security threat or interfere with someone else's free speech. Even better, the law says companies are not allowed to treat you differently or charge you money just for exercising your data rights. There's also a special restriction for children: If you're under 16, a company needs you to explicitly opt in before they can sell your information. Q: Is it like the European law? A: The CCPA is a bit like a European law you may have heard about, called the General Data Protection Regulation. What's different is that the CCPA doesn't require companies to minimize the data they collect in the first place. Privacy advocates also think the CCPA is sorely missing the ability for consumers to file lawsuits against companies that violate their rights. Only the California attorney general can do that now. Q: How much work is this? A: You have to go to each and every company to exercise your CCPA rights. Yes, that could become a never-ending project. But the good news is that many companies have web forms you can fill out like busywork. I submitted about a hundred in less time than it took me to binge the most recent season of "The Crown." So far there's no tool to help you do this all at once or service that will manage your data for you, though I've heard from several start-ups working on that. Keep in mind that some online services, including Facebook, say a "delete" request involves totally shutting your account, rather than just pressing a reset button on all the unwelcome surveillance of your life. Q: What hoops might companies make me jump through? A: Before you dive into making requests, get organized. You'll need to have access to your usernames, passwords and loyalty card numbers. (If you don't already have a password manager to keep all your important information organized, this is an excellent time to get one.) Companies can ask you to prove your identity, and if there are errors or missing information they can reject your request. Scan or photograph your driver's license; many sites required me to upload it, or a version that was redacted. Data firm Wiland even asked me for a notarized letter. (I reminded it that CCPA requests aren't supposed to cost consumers anything, and the company suggested I seek out a free notary at a government office or credit union.) Some companies will try to shift work onto you. Airbnb and PayPal, among others, make you email them requests, rather than using web forms. Instead of a simple "do not sell" switch, companies including MasterCard make you manage a series of privacy "preferences" (as if anyone's preference would be to have their data sold). To opt out, Best Buy says you have to change your web browser to block all cookies (breaking some sites) and dig into your phone settings to turn off some advertising tracking. Don't let any of this stop you from demanding your rights. The most common annoyance is firms hiding their CCPA instructions behind many links and impenetrable privacy policies. Q: Is there any information that isn't covered? A: Companies don't have to share information that's already public, that they've collected in a job interview or that they've aggregated in ways that don't identify you. Some companies have come up short in what they actually disclose. For example, in CCPA requests it returned to me, Amazon has yet to share what data it collects in its camera-equipped Amazon Go convenience stores. And businesses already covered by a few existing privacy laws are exempt — even if those laws don't require transparency like the CCPA. That means banks and doctor's offices generally don't have to abide. Q: What counts as data ‘sale'? A: This is one of the most-debated questions in tech right now. The CCPA says selling data is a transfer of information for commercial purposes. That's obvious where one company pays another for, say, your burrito purchase history. But many businesses, particularly ones involved in online advertising, pass along information in other ways, such as tracker cookies and pixels hidden on websites and apps. Some of the biggest firms, including Facebook, Amazon and Google, contend the "do not sell" request part of the CCPA doesn't apply to them because they don't sell our data. They just make billions off our data by using it to target ads and train artificial intelligence software. Others are claiming an out because the law is too vague. For example, Spotify's privacy policy says it shares your personal information with advertisers — but the music service doesn't think that should count as a sale. "It is currently unclear whether the use of certain types of advertising partners would be considered a sale under CCPA," the company says. The authors of the CCPA say they intended the term "sale" to reflect the wider data economy. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra hasn't yet published guidelines for how his office will interpret the law, and we might not get firm answers until his office begins enforcing it. That's set to begin July 1. Q: Once I have my data, what do I do with it? A: First, keep it secure by storing it only on a computer you control with a password. Most of the data requests I've received so far have come in formats I can easily read, such as text files or PDFs. But not all: Twitter sent me files in a. js format that requires a data science degree to understand. (The company says it is working to improve that.) I'm still waiting to hear back on most of my requests; the law gives companies up to 90 days to deliver. But already I learned that WiFi router maker Eero, owned by Amazon, keeps a detailed log of every device that's ever connected to my network. (It's like a creepy visitor guest book.) Fandango not only tallied all the movies I've watched but also concluded I have an affinity for the Muppets. (True.) When you examine your data, keep an eye out for information you didn't know the company had — or don't think it should. If you don't like what you see, submit a CCPA delete request. Or stop doing business with the company, and be sure to tell it why. If you think a company is violating your privacy — or violating the CCPA — you can complain to the California attorney general (click here for a direct link). Q: OK, let's do it! Where do I click? A: The list below includes many of the companies where I've submitted CCPA requests. I've separated out the companies that have indicated they'll offer CCPA rights to all Americans. There are more resources available: A crowdsourced list stored on GitHub, an online resource for coders, has an even longer list of links to company-specific CCPA information pages. Common Sense Media is also building out the website Donotsell.org as a resource for CCPA requests, as is CAPrivacy.org, run by one of the authors of the law. The Electronic Frontier Foundation offers a simple guide on its website, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center has a handy draft form letter to use in cases where companies don't offer web forms. If you're looking for a company not included in any of these resources, I recommend finding the privacy policy on its website and searching for the word California — that's typically the best place to start. These companies accept CCPA requests from all Americans: Amazon Apple DoorDash Facebook Google Lutron Microsoft Netflix PayPal Ring Roku Starbucks Strava Toyota Twitter Uber UPS Wiland Zillow — — — These companies accept CCPA requests from California residents: Acxiom Airbnb Alaska Airlines Albertsons/Safeway Altria AT&T Best Buy BevMo Chipotle Comcast Xfinity CVS Disney Dominos eBay Eero Epsilon Equifax Equinox Experian Face App Ford General Motors Honda Hulu i360 JetBlue Kayak Live Nation LiveRamp Lyft Macy's Marriott MasterCard Nissan OpenTable Orangetheory Fitness Pinterest Quora Redfin Resy Samsung SiriusXM Southwest Airlines Spotify Staples Target Ticketmaster TransUnion Truedata Uber Unilever Verizon Verizon Media Visa Volkswagen Walmart Washington Post Whitepages Whole Foods Yelp

UI says development key to fighting brain drain, racial disparities in private sector SPRINGFIELD — University of Illinois faculty say an ongoing statewide investment in a public-private research network is key to boosting the state's economy. The Discovery Partners Institute, a UI-led research and workforce development hub based in Chicago, is the flagship program of the Illinois Innovation Network that seeks to invest in 15 regional hubs affiliated with the UI system to spur economic growth with state funding. The goal of IIN is to create technology jobs in Illinois and train the state's workforce to fill them. UI representatives testified before the state Senate Higher Education Committee during a subject matter hearing on Monday, claiming that despite Illinois' success in business and STEM education, the state hasn't seen the economic boon to match its academic output. 
"So, broadly, the great thing about Illinois is it is a place where talent gets created, it has tremendous capabilities in creating tech talent," DPI Director Bill Jackson said in his testimony. According to UI's presentation, Illinois is second nationally in computer science graduates and food research and development, fourth in MBA graduates, and fifth in data science graduates. But this hasn't translated to the private sector, leading to a "brain drain" of Illinois-educated tech workers, he said. "But, our issue, right, is we lose that talent," Jackson said. "It goes to the coast, it goes other places and it doesn't stay within the state. We do all the development and we don't get the essence of all that great capability we're building." Illinois is 31st in state economic growth, 46th in private job growth, and 62 percent of computer science graduates leave the state after receiving their degree, according to the university's representatives. On top of that, half of all startups that raise more than $5 million relocate. The UI's tech programs are also not racially equitable. In Chicago, Black residents and Latino residents each make up around 30 percent of the city's population. Cumulatively, they make up 12 percent of Chicago's tech workforce, despite accounting for 60 percent of the general population. In 2019, less than 2 percent of UI system computer and data science graduates were Black, while 5 percent were Latino. The UI representatives contended that this disparity limits the workforce that can be developed to address personnel shortfalls in the tech industry and keeps Illinois behind other states like California and Washington, which have seen similar levels of academic success as Illinois but have reaped larger growth in the private sector. The solution, according to UI's presentation, is continued investment in computer science classes and computer science teachers in public schools zoned for underserved communities. They also promote programs that target Black and Latino K-12 students to establish a pipeline for earning computer and data science degrees at Illinois universities. DPI's Chicago campus, in a development area called The 78, is scheduled to be completed by 2025. Most of the other hubs are situated on public university campuses and in existing structures and are scheduled to be operational over the next few years. Hubs will have an established focus based on their region and the university that houses them. Focus areas include computing and data, food and agriculture, entrepreneurship and environment, and water. An economic impact statement crafted by the Boston Consulting Group in late 2019 claims DPI and IIN will generate $198 billion in economic activity and create or fill 48,000 jobs over the next 10 years. The study says that by the 2029 fiscal year, the project will create or fill more than 9,500 jobs annually, with 4,500 of those going to individuals from underserved backgrounds. State Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, who represents the Champaign area including UI's flagship campus, pressed UI system witnesses on how effective their project would really be in cultivating tech talent in the state. Rose cited a Wall Street Journal article discussing how the world's largest tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are creating 6-month vocational programs that are meant to serve as a competing and equal credential to a 4-year degree. "It seems to me the private marketplace is now going to cannibalize our students," Rose said. "What is this space that DPI is trying to capture where it is a market leader that is not already captured by someone else, not captured by Austin, not captured by Silicon Valley, not captured by Boston or by North Carolina?" Jackson said that while Google and other big tech corporations are filling one gap in the marketplace, DPI will create the capacity for more tech jobs in the state. He also said that its different hubs and focus on creating pipelines in K-12 education allow it to fill multiple market gaps outside of just data science. According to Jackson, Illinois institutions are uniquely situated for developing digital agriculture, transportation logistics and medical research. Rose said he was pleased with the idea of DPI and IIN for boosting Illinois' economy through the technology sector, but he cautioned the state "not to create a wheel that's already been created somewhere else." DPI and IIN were originally approved under former Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2017 but had funding delayed over the course of his term. The state released $500 million in state funds for DPI and IIN in February, with another $501 million in nonstate funds being committed to both projects. At the senate committee on Monday, UI system representatives said half of the state funds will go to DPI and the other half to the 14 other hubs in the network. According to UI representatives, only a portion of that money has been distributed for the planning and construction of DPI and five other hubs so far. Those hubs include Eastern Illinois University, Governors State University, Chicago State University, University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. * Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government and distributed to more than 400 newspapers statewide. It is funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.

(IIT) — Responding to a growing need for people who can turn big data into intelligent insights, Illinois Institute of Technology has launched a new Master of Data Science (MAS DS) program for fall 2013.
The rigorous and interdisciplinary program combines high-level mathematics and computer science theory with the practical knowledge to explore data sets, gather insights, and visualize and communicate meaningful findings.
Unlike many data analytics and business intelligence degree programs, the IIT MAS DS program focuses on acquiring deep knowledge and understanding of the theory behind machine learning and data mining; object-oriented programming skills; understanding of scientific problems and processes; and skill in facilitating effective communication with scientific and business collaborators.
Students will have the opportunity to work on real data science projects through a practicum at the end of the program.
"Educating data scientists is a multifaceted task," said Shlomo Argamon, professor of computer science and co-director of the program.
"We will teach our students the theory and practice of statistics, data mining, and scalable computing in depth; train them in communications and design skills; and provide them with practical experience integrating their knowledge, guided by academic and industrial mentors."
Argamon added, "Of particular importance is the fact that we weave discussion of ethical principles and their application throughout the curriculum, to ensure that our graduates will be prepared to act with the highest standards of professionalism."
The launch of IIT's data science program comes at a time when data are being acquired faster than ever before and are being used to make decisions on business, health care, science, and government policy. The average company with over 1,000 employees has hundreds of terabytes of stored data and many companies are even producing tens of terabytes per day. As the amount of data in the world continues to grow, so does the demand for data scientists who can make sense of these large data sets. Between 2011 and 2012, there was a 15,000 percent increase in job postings for data scientists, according to Harvard Business Review.
IIT is located in Chicago, a key hub for data science research and industry, with a large concentration of companies working in or using data science in the area.

WASHINGTON — A second COVID-19 vaccine moved closer to joining the U.S. fight against the pandemic Thursday as government advisers convened for a public review of its safety and effectiveness. It's the next-to-last step for the vaccine developed by drugmaker Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. The panel of physicians and medical researchers is expected to endorse it, followed by the Food and Drug Administration's OK within hours or days. The action would provide a boost to the largest vaccination effort in U.S. history that kicked off this week. 
More shipments of the first greenlighted vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, were going out Thursday, earmarked for health care workers and nursing home residents around the country. A second vaccine is urgently needed as coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise in the U.S. ahead of holiday travel and gatherings that are expected to further fuel the pandemic. The FDA's Dr. Doran Fink opened the daylong meeting reiterating that the agency's review would be "transparent, scientifically sound and data-driven." Moderna's vaccine is largely following the same path as Pfizer-BioNTech's, which relies on the same groundbreaking technology. Most traditional vaccines use dead or weakened virus, but both of the new vaccines use snippets of COVID-19's genetic code to train the immune system to detect and fight the virus. Both require two doses, weeks apart. The rapid development of two highly effective vaccines using the novel technique is one of the scientific triumphs in the race against coronavirus. "This is coming much faster than what anybody thought," said Dr. Jesse Goodman, of Georgetown University, former chief of the FDA's vaccine division. "Something that might have otherwise taken several years — to take this new vaccine technology and test it and approve it — was compressed into within a year." But he added both vaccines have only been studied in volunteers for a few months and more follow-up is needed to answer important questions, such as how long protection lasts. Another unanswered question is whether the vaccine also prevents people from symptomless infection — but Moderna found a hint that it may. Study participants had their noses swabbed before a second dose of either vaccine or placebo. At that one timepoint, tests from 14 vaccine recipients and 38 placebo recipients showed evidence of asymptomatic infection, said Moderna's Dr. Jacqueline Miller. A speedy FDA ruling seems almost certain after the agency issued a positive review Tuesday confirming the Moderna shot's safety and effectiveness. Moderna's vaccine would remain experimental as the company's two-year study of 30,000 people continues. In scrutinizing early results of the study, the FDA found the vaccine was more than 94% effective overall at preventing COVID-19. No major safety problems appeared. Side effects typically seen with vaccinations were common, such as fever, fatigue and muscle aches. If authorized by the FDA, U.S. officials said the initial shipment of nearly 6 million doses would also go to health workers and nursing homes. The new vaccine needs to be stored at regular freezer temperatures, but not the ultracold required for Pfizer-BioNTech's shot. The independent review by FDA's vaccine panel is considered key to easing public skepticism about the safety of the vaccine. The panel is likely to debate guidance for key groups who could face greater risk or uncertainty, such as pregnant women. While pregnant women were excluded from Moderna's study, FDA reviewers noted 13 new pregnancies among participants after the study got underway. The impact of the vaccine on those pregnancies is "unknown at this time," the FDA review found. If FDA follows the course it did with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, pregnant women would be told to consult their doctor first. The vaccine was also not studied in children, and would only be authorized for people 18 and older. Pfizer's shot was cleared for teenagers 16 and up. The panel is also likely to scrutinize Moderna's data for any hints of rare, serious allergic reactions. On its first day of vaccinations with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, Britain reported two serious allergic reactions among people who had a history of allergies so severe that they always carried EpiPens. And on Wednesday, officials in Alaska reported a serious allergic reaction in a health worker who had no known allergies to vaccines. The FDA says the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be given to anyone who doesn't have a history of allergic reactions to one of its ingredients, such as polyethylene glycol, a chemical found in many drugs and foods. The FDA found no severe allergic reactions in Moderna's data but flagged a slightly higher rate of less serious hypersensitivity reactions among participants who got the vaccine, compared with those receiving a dummy shot. Regulators also noted three cases of Bell's palsy, which temporarily paralyzes facial muscles, among vaccine recipients, compared with just one among those getting a dummy shot. The FDA review said the role of shot in potentially triggering the cases in the vaccine group "cannot be ruled out." Similar cases were reported during the review of Pfizer's vaccine. Ultimately, the FDA said it would carefully monitor the problem as the vaccine rolls out. While Moderna's vaccine is made with the same technology as the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, they're not identical, cautioned Moderna chief medical officer Dr. Tal Zaks. In particular, some of the lipids, or fats, used to coat the two vaccines are different. "I would not necessarily assume" that any reactions would be the same, he said. After the panel vote, the FDA will face pressure to quickly grant emergency approval, as it did last week when FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn was reportedly threatened with possible removal by the White House if the agency didn't move fast enough. Asked about the day's events earlier this week, Hahn reiterated that "science and data" are guiding the agency's decisions, a mantra he has repeated for months. "We're not going to let politics enter into this," Hahn said in an online interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association. "This isn't about me, it's not about any individual, it's about the American people."

Avoid politics disguised as science
I am concerned when I read a letter such as Charles Benedetti's portrayal of the health dangers of GMOs.
Mr. Benedetti may believe that GMOs are unsafe, and he can make the choice to purchase food that has not been genetically modified. But, his claim that scientific research data supports him is false.
Unless a study is controlled, with multiple trials, and peer-reviewed by experts in the field, it cannot be considered "science." The scenarios presented in Mr. Benedetti's letter are scary but not science: these reports are not based on scientific evidence but on correlations made without controls or hard data. And, science never says "proven." It is always open to new information, new studies, new and better evaluation of those studies.
Just as I would suspect research paid for by Monsanto, so I suspect research done by a man (Jeffrey Smith, author of "Seeds of Deception") whose education is the Maharishi University of Management. He may be a best-seller, but he's not a scientist.
Nor do I value information from organizations such as EWG (Environmental Working Group) whose reports are seldom science-based but are geared toward a political agenda and fundraising, and also often involve scare tactics.
One of EWG's most egregious allegations was the now-infamous, completely fabricated link between autism and vaccines.
Just because a group is a nonprofit or contains scientific-sounding words does not make its agenda valid. It might take a little time, but with computer access to almost unlimited information, it is easy to check the credentials of experts and their claims.
Someone purporting scientific studies should reference a peer-reviewed science journal within the article. Please do yourself and your family a favor by not being taken in by the hype of misinformation.

Grants to help hook students on science, math

Christine Bodden wasn't yet sold on a career in chemistry.
But she said yes when her Harper College teachers urged her to partake in hands-on research, prompting her later to compete for - and get - a 10-week summer research stint at a four-year college in Michigan.
Then she was hooked.
The 25-year-old Wheeling resident now is working away on an enzyme inhibitor that could prevent blood clots in stroke or heart attack victims, and preparing to transfer, if the financial aid comes through, to Michigan's Hope College to finish her chemistry degree.
You don't have to be a - well - scientist, her teachers say, to figure out what went right with Bodden: Once her interest was piqued, the love affair began.
They want to make that happen more often, and now they have the funding to do it.
Armed with a nearly $3 million National Science Foundation grant, Harper, nearby Oakton Community College and other Chicago- area two-year colleges will begin offering more students the rare chance to do research in their first years on campus, and continue such work during summer stints at four-year colleges.
With help from a separate $1 million grant, Oakton will promote science careers to high-schoolers, and offer fellowships, mentoring and more to keep students on campus to earn science-related diplomas.
All the initiatives are aimed at grabbing, and maintaining, students' interest in science and math. And all address what experts say is a national problem: Not enough students are sticking with those fields long enough to complete a degree.
For the past three decades, science and engineering degrees have accounted for about one-third of U.S. bachelor's degrees, according to National Science Foundation data.
Not bad, some acknowledge.
But not so good, either - particularly compared with the global picture. In Japan, China and South Korea, far higher percentages of grads are collecting their degrees in the engineering and science areas.
"It's a national concern," said Harper College's Dan Stanford. "We are behind the world."
America's picture may be a product of several issues, from teens not sticking with math through high school to students becoming enamored of other fields that promise quick, big salaries, experts said.
But if it's just a general lack of interest, Harper and Oakton are ready to tackle the problem.
With the $3 million, five-year grant, Harper, Oakton, College of DuPage and other two-year community colleges will:
- Offer select students - and not always just those earning A's - hands-on research opportunities they wouldn't typically get until they'd moved on to a four-year university;
- Partner with colleges like Illinois State to let students research there over the summer;
- Make a push to get under-represented groups, like blacks and Hispanics, into the program and hooked on science.
Oakton's separate nearly $1 million grant, spread out over four years, will help the college:
- Recruit science, technology, engineering and math students through high school programs, including informational forums and competitions;
- Engage and retain current students with things like study sessions, field trips and seminars on succeeding in the field;
- Give those who place into remedial math or those with limited English skills extra support and motivation in science;
- Offer a mentoring program that matches select science students with a faculty mentor and hands students - as many as 60 or so a semester - $400 fellowships when they're done;
- Provide programs that train students to be peer tutors, let them work in college laboratories or partake in internships.
The National Science Foundation doles out about $80 million in grants to community colleges each year, the organization's Elizabeth Teles said, amid the knowledge that about half the nation's college students are studying in such institutions. Two- year colleges also have seen a notable increase in minority enrollment.

Byron York should check his facts It is so ironic that today's column in the Daily Herald by Byron York on how voters viewed where sources of misinformation came from during the presidential campaign contains misinformation being spread by the author himself. In it, he makes two misleading claims about the Hunter Biden laptop story. First, he states the material that was published by the New York Post was accurate. This is a reference to an email from a Burisma official purportedly thanking Hunter Biden for setting up a meeting between the official and Joe Biden. No evidence that the meeting actually took place was ever provided, and the paper was criticized for relying on questionable sources. 
Joe Biden has denied the meeting ever took place. Then, later in the column, he says the material is the subject of a federal investigation. He conveniently leaves out the fact the FBI is investigating Rudy Giuliani, the source of the laptop, for spreading Russian propaganda and not any wrongdoing by the Bidens. With right-wing columnists continuing to spread misinformation like this, It's no wonder that Republican voters distrust the mainstream media as much as they do. Richard Keslinke Algonquin We need Kinzinger and nuclear power Thank you, Daily Herald, for your Dec. 16 editorial in praise of Rep. Adam Kinzinger for defending against the unfounded attacks on our election system. Rep. Kinzinger is among the few Republicans who put our country ahead of politics in this time of unprecedented division. He has also spoken out on how important it is for America to not lose its largest source of environmentally clean and reliable energy — our nuclear power units. As a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Kinzinger has fought for legislation that would support our aging but valuable nuclear fleet and prevent the loss of the thousands of good-paying jobs. It is time for Rep. Kinzinger and members of Congress on both sides to recognize a bipartisan approach that would not only prevent the shutdown of these valuable assets, but would also accelerate the transition to an economy no longer reliant on fossil fuels. Place a gradually rising price on fossil fuel carbon at its source and return most of the proceeds to Americans. This approach seriously addresses climate change, improves air quality and is supported by virtually all economists, major corporations and the international community. Sen. Dick Durbin's America's Clean Future Fund Act and the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act are examples of such policy. Predictable pricing allows market forces to determine energy investments without using government regulations or mandates. Tom Rausch Glen Ellyn I'm an expert; I'm getting vaccinated As a physician, scientist, infectious-disease specialist and member of the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, I draw hope from this month's COVID-19 vaccine developments — and we also must double down on mitigation measures that will keep us safe until sufficient doses are administered to bring the pandemic under control. While it is true that the first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have landed in Chicago and front-line health workers are receiving it, we must not make the mistake of letting our guard down. We need to protect our most at-risk citizens first with the initial limited supply of doses, and there is no easy estimate about when all of us will be vaccinated. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are safe and effective for use in adults. I have publicly stated that we should collect, analyze and review more safety and efficacy data on clinical trial participants under 18 years of age. Having said this, my confidence in the vaccines is such that, if my priority-risk group were called in to receive a dose, I would be first in line to do so. Vaccinations will be one of the mechanisms through which we will bring this global health crisis to an end. Until that time comes, we must exercise common sense and remain vigilant in our daily lives. Additional data and science will lead us to a better place if we continue to grant them our patience. Dr. Archana Chatterjee Dean, Chicago Medical School; Vice President for Medical Affairs; Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science Dan Moran Communications Director Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science North Chicago U.S. could lose by reducing emissions Biden and his devout followers have great ambitions for cutting U.S. emissions to net zero by the year 2050. I have questions that are routinely ignored. Quoting Biden: "We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home." He fails to mentions the millions of jobs that are to be lost through his plan. The following countries represent the largest global polluters: China at 30%, United States at 15%, India at 7%, Russia at 5% and Japan at 4%. Only the U.S. has cut its emissions by 7% in the past few years. Even if the U.S. cuts its emissions to nothing, how do we rely on these other countries to cut their emissions? The U.S. is Number 10 on the list of countries with the cleanest air. Arab countries account for the top 10 countries with the most air pollution. How do we force countries like Iran and Pakistan to forgo economic development in trade for cleaner air? Cutting emissions should be a global goal, but it seems the only the U.S. and Japan will be harmed with Biden's plan. You cannot trust these other countries to conform with this policy, and you can't put a dome over them to keep their pollutants from drifting into U.S. airspace. Let's think this out before jumping into something that will harm our economy and our citizens. Larry Casey Huntley Compromise and courtesy needed I fear that some very important C-words have been vanishing from our political arena over the past several years. These words are courtesy, cooperation, collaboration, compromise, and consensus. Although this concern has always existed in our two-party political system, I believe it has gotten worse. The unwillingness of our political leaders to reach agreement on each other's proposals for most issues affect our country. Given the economic destruction the pandemic has caused for millions of Americans, I see no good-faith efforts of give-and-take on another stimulus package. And I wonder if any change in our political leadership is capable of restoring the C-words that have faded from both sides of the aisle. But I have hope. John Petrik Bartlett Please go blue, Georgia voters I can't help wondering if Corporate Persons, the legal fiction named in the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling, had been vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus, that there would have been more interest on the part of Mitch McConnell and his Senate majority in providing relief to the living, breathing citizens of the United States of America. Now that the Georgia runoff election looms large, they are eager to appear to care about ordinary people. But the liability protection for business still stands as a roadblock to this essential legislation. The nation now depends on Georgia to save the Union. Jill Versace Naperville

Serving voters, not politics Marty McLaughlin is the clear choice when casting your vote for state representative for the 52nd district. As village president in Barrington Hills, Marty has worked tirelessly to streamline government, resolve pension issues, lower taxes and recognize opposing views. His financial background and pension expertise will help bring reform and responsibility to Illinois's disastrous overspending and overtaxing. Our state is in crisis and needs a known leader not a Madigan-funded rookie. Vote for Marty McLaughlin. 
He will represent our interests in Springfield, not Madigan's or other special interest groups' agendas. Don Spry Barrington Hills Low personal attacks I read Mr. McCarte's September 22 "Your Views" letter "Not Worthy of Praise." I found it to be a personally vindictive, demeaning, invective of conservative Jeanne Ives. As usual, "progressives" like him choose to demean, vilify and totally disrespect the personal side of their opponents. Why? Because, they know if they state/debate their policies — green new deal, eliminating fossil fuels our lifeblood and a global economic engine; higher taxes wiping out the economic gains of our middle class; no borders, everyone welcome regardless their economic abilities, talents, their felonious backgrounds — they will be quickly rejected by voters in favor of Ms. Ives' conservative policies designed to continue the economic charge begun by President Donald Trump for all Americans. Rep. Casten is a prime example of the Progressive Left's attempts to destroy America. Fie on him and those of his ilk. Jim Thompson Lake Barrington Represents best qualities The 14th District constituents deserve the quality of representation that Lauren Underwood has brought to the U.S. House of Representatives. She is the true embodiment of the qualities that we should all aspire to. She listens to, cares about and represents all constituents of the 14th District. She has an infectious smile, positive attitude and calm demeanor. But this has not stopped her from working hard and fighting for the issues that are important to her constituents. With her background in nursing and health care she has focused on bringing down the cost of prescription drugs, supporting fair coverage of preexisting conditions and other issues important to the 14th District and the Nation. She is capable of and works well reaching across the aisle to work with honest Republicans. This is in stark contrast to the dark and negative perennial candidate Jim Oberweis, who has failed five out of six times running for a state or federal elective office. Oberweis is following in Trump's footsteps with his "attack" ads against Underwood as pointed out by the Daily Herald, Sun-Times and BGA PolitiFact Illinois. He uses lies and misrepresentations to attack his opponents. He has called Rep. Underwood a radical socialist and even mocked her nursing credentials. The Chicago Sun-Times displays the headline" Fact-check: No beauty in Oberweis' milking of Underwood's answer to ‘rioting and looting' question." This is just the tip of the iceberg. Despite his false and misleading ads, his campaign says they will stay up. They know they are lying, but they don't care. Anything to gain power. Oberweis supports Trump and his authoritarian regime. The 14th District deserves a positive, honest and hardworking representative to represent us in Washington. Please join with us in supporting and sending Lauren back to Washington. David and Michelle Johnson Geneva Voting my values I think there are stark moral and positional differences between the two candidates running for US Congress in the 14th District. I am a Christian and a conservative. I'm voting my values; I'm voting Oberweis: I am pro-life; Mr. Oberweis is pro-life. I support law and order; Mr. Oberweis does as well. I believe Nancy Pelosi is extreme and out-of-touch with conservative values. I believe Mike Madigan and the Illinois "Democratic machine" are corrupt. I do not support taxpayer-funded benefits and health care for illegal immigrants. I have not met Ms. Underwood, but I assume she is a sincere and decent individual. The problem is that Ms. Underwood is 100% aligned with Nancy Pelosi and the extreme policies of the Democratic Party. I have met and talked with Jim Oberweis. I judge him to be a sensible, fair and open-minded person who cares about our district and will vote on issues that reflect the hardworking families who live here. Peaceful protest is lawful; rioting and burning down businesses is wrong. I believe we do need common sense law enforcement reform, but the idea of defunding police is a mistake. Underwood has not condemned the rioting and looting destroying our cities. Jim Oberweis has. Underwood has voted 100% in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi. It seems to me that Underwood's voting record aligns with the Democratic Party, much more than with her constituents. Jim Oberweis is moderate, and I believe he will represent all the residents in our district. Jim Oberweis has denounced the Madigan corruption; Ms. Underwood has not. Instead, she has taken thousands from Madigan to aid her campaign. For me, the choice is simple. Jim Oberweis has my vote. Lance Foust Sugar Grove State's future at stake While Gov. Pritzker likes to dub it the "fair tax," in reality there is nothing fair about it at all. What is real, however, is the sorry condition of our state's fiscal health. What does passing this tax mean? It means that 25% of small businesses subject to pass-through taxes, those that have managed to survive the pandemic and possibly also looting, will be subject to higher taxes. It means that retirement earnings will very likely be taxed, as they are in every other state that has a progressive income tax. It means that income taxes can now be levied at the municipal level, adding yet another layer of taxation in the state that already exceeds all others in the nation in that respect. It means that Illinois residents can be taxed at any rate and in more respects than ever before. Politicians in the state with the most corrupt reputation in the nation tell us that we should trust them to only tax the rich when in fact we give them the option to tax at any level and at any rate they choose. Politicians who have done essentially nothing to fix the state's pension crisis are asking taxpayers to dig deeper into our pockets yet again. Passing the progressive income tax will truly be the final nail in the coffin for Illinois. Please support our retirees. Please support our small business owners. Please support our taxpayers in general. Please vote no if you care about the future of our state. Julie Fox West Dundee Health care savings I think most of America is aware of the president's campaign to lower the cost of drugs. I am an 80-year-old diabetic. I live in Sun City Huntley with a lot of other seniors. For this year and next, I am and will be on an AARP Medicare Advantage Program. I take Levemir Flex Touch Insulin. I use just over 1 pen every two days. When I got to the "doughnut hole," it was out of pocket. This year my cost was $290.00 per month. Next year with the same company, my cost will be $35.00 per month, even in the doughnut hole. This is because of our Congresswoman Laura Underwood and our President Donald J. Trump. This year I will save well over $1,500. I am not telling you how to vote, but I know how I will. Richard A. Baron Huntley Dangerous COVID-19 plan Jeanne Ives is promoting a dangerous scheme to resolve COVID-19 economic issues. Known as the Great Barrington Declaration, it recommends isolating elderly and medically vulnerable, while allowing the virus to spread, unchecked, to achieve herd immunity. The declaration is deeply flawed. First, it isn't known if infection makes a person immune to future infection. Second, the declaration is theoretical and vague. It doesn't define elderly or medically vulnerable. It doesn't explain how to isolate huge swaths of the population for indefinite lengths of time. Third, per the Mayo Clinic, experts estimate 200 million would have to recover to halt the epidemic. This amount of infection could lead to serious complications, millions of deaths, overwhelm our hospitals and further destroy our economy. The president can't or won't lead a coordinated national response to COVID-19. The nation has been left rudderless, with governors forced to confront this crisis largely on their own. After eight months, 228,000 dead, a weakened economy, and no end in sight, vulnerable citizens are being preyed upon for political gain. Ives claims Sean Casten is proposing a complete shutdown. That's a lie. Sean Casten endorses a science-based, ethical path to reduce lockdowns and virus spread until a vaccine is ready; a plan developed by public health experts and epidemiologists. This includes social distancing, hand washing, contact tracing, increased testing, mask usage, and limited restrictions as circumstances require. Congressman Casten voted for several bills to provide individuals and businesses economic relief, provide funds to hospitals and health care workers for PPE, allocate monies for increased testing, development of treatments, a vaccine, and more. He, unlike Ives, understands we can achieve both public health safety and economic security. We must not accept immoral, wrong-headed proposals masquerading as science. Vote for Sean Casten for IL-06 on or before Nov. 3. Jacqueline Eberle Crystal Lake Missing obvious truths U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood talks a lot about science. We are constantly told about how she always "follows the science." Science, as we all know, is based on facts and based on verifiable outcomes and data. So how is it that someone who seems to be so grounded in science can ignore the obvious truths about the rioting and looting taking place in communities across the nation? Of course, the people protesting in the streets during the day are good, upstanding citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights, but then when the sun goes down, the protests turn violent. People's property is being destroyed and lives are being lost. This is happening. You can't close your eyes and pretend that it is not. The violence is real. The lives lost are real. And unfortunately, Lauren Underwood's denial of what is right in front of her is also real. So much for following the "science" and data. How can Lauren Underwood ever hope to lead on solutions for the problems facing our nation when she can't even acknowledge what those problems are? She can't. We need and deserve better leadership. Vote Jim Oberweis for Congress in the 14th District. Paul Powers St. Charles Lift the stranglehold The voting citizens of the 25th Senate and the 49th, 50th and 65th representative districts have before them candidates who require careful consideration. You have Keith Wheeler and Dan Ugaste, the incumbents that have served their districts with distinction. The 49th is an open seat, as is the 25th. It must be pointed out that the Democratic challengers have accepted substantial campaign funds from the political arm of Madigan and Pritzker. They will go to Springfield and do as they are told by the speaker and governor and will not be independent of their control. An example of this is the Fair Tax Amendment. The lieutenant governor dropped the ball when she spilled the strategy that if the amendment does not pass we will suffer a 20% increase in the income tax. Maura, Karina and Martha support increasing your taxes one way or another. How many more of my friends and neighbors will leave for friendlier states. When residents flee for friendly tax climates, those of us who remain will continue to carry the increased burden to support services. Maura, Martha and Karina tell you that they will fight for families and seniors and businesses but if there is no money, what will you fight with? The big-dollar donors will continue to gobble up the small resources that might remain in the budget. And the budget fiasco and property tax relief gets kicked down the road once again. And have seen the horrific mailers being sent out about the Republican candidates? Do you want to vote for candidates with no sense of decency and ethical conduct. Stop Madigan and Pritzker. Provide opposition to their stranglehold and force them to negotiate solutions that can fix the Illinois fiscal mess. So vote for Keith Wheeler, Laura Curtis, Dan Ugaste and Jeanette Ward.

Q: What has Donald Trump's unconventional leadership taught us about politics in

Q: What has Donald Trump's unconventional leadership taught us about politics in the United States? What is the best thing his presidency has done? What is the most significant criticism you have of it? Ramirez Mukherjee: In politics, like everything else in life, both action and words matter. President Trump's disruption of the political status quo and economic policy successes are undeniable, but his rhetoric is untenable. 
Until the pandemic, his economic policies had positively impacted every segment of American society, and his disruption put both allies and enemies that took us for granted on notice. While the straight talk and irreverence for political correctness are refreshing, the singular focus on the economy, even when faced with hard science and data to do otherwise when confronting a pandemic, was ill-advised. The dual impacts of the pandemic and rhetoric have exposed latent feelings and attitudes and unnecessarily politicized the issue. This was a missed opportunity to lead by example. Schneider: My criticisms of the Trump Administration are too many to list. Of most immediate consequence is his almost complete failure to lead the nation through the COVID-19 pandemic. His abdication of responsibility has resulted in a health crisis far worse than in other developed nations, and has brought a catastrophic economic crisis, with small businesses closing, families being evicted, and cities facing bankruptcy. His administration refuses to provide Americans with guidance to safely reopen our schools and workplaces. We have no comprehensive testing plan, no contact tracing protocols, no mechanism to manage the nation's supply chain to deliver medicines, equipment and PPE. His indifference is increasing the burden on doctors, nurses, teachers, firefighters, police or other front-line workers, while at the same time leaving them at risk of being furloughed or even fired. The President's most significant accomplishment of his presidency has been signing the "First Step Act," which moved the ball forward on criminal justice reform. As the bill's name implies, we still have much work to do on the matter. Q: Many critics of governmental process complain that both Barack Obama and Donald Trump governed too much through executive orders rather than in collaboration with Congress. Is our system in danger of veering toward authoritarianism? From a structural standpoint, does Congress need to place stronger limits on the power of the presidency? If so, be specific on what some of those limits might be. If not, please explain your view. Ramirez Mukherjee: Presidents would not have to use executive orders if Congress did their job, and no, Congress does not need to limit Presidential powers. Executive orders are a symptom, not the cause, of the extreme polarization of politics and misguided focus in Congress. For example, Congressman Schneider has been in office for six years and raised almost $20,000,000 to get elected. What are his results? Nothing. Zero of his sponsored bills have become law, yet during that time 624 laws sponsored by his peers have become laws. So he is six years, $20,000,000 raised, and 0 of 624. He's not alone, though. You have performers and underperformers just like you would in any industry. But the difference is in Congress the underperformers get away with it if they can be a star fundraiser — like Congressman Schneider and his low performing peers who chair the Democratic fundraising arm with him — another Illinois member of Congress. The media tends to focus on fundraising quarterly rather than publishing who is getting stuff done. And our voters suffer the consequences of that. If we change our attention to results, I think we could change the effectiveness of Congress rather quickly. Schneider: For now, more than a generation preceding Obama and Trump, Congress has ceded too much power to the executive branch and we need to take back our authority. We need to get back to a robust system of checks and balances as envisioned by our founders. For example, we must update the War Powers Act and reauthorize existing AUMFs. Finally, we need to expand Congress's enforcement of its oversight duties. The American people deserve better from Washington in total. The most important governmental reform that the House has worked on this Congress is H.R. 1, the "For the People Act," to clean up corruption and restore public trust in our government. I am thrilled that this legislation includes a bill I previously introduced to strengthen the firewall between public service and corporate lobbying. Coupled with other reforms, including restricting the influence of dark money in campaigns, bolstering voting rights protections, and limiting corporate influence, the For the People Act would make our government more responsive and effective in making progress for the American people, and less susceptible to authoritarianism. Q: Protesters have massed in the streets throughout America calling for greater social justice. How significant a role does systemic racism play in limiting equal opportunity in America? To the degree that it exists, what should be done about it? Do you favor reparations? Should police be "defunded"? Ramirez Mukherjee: Racism, whether systemic, inadvertent, or latent, does play a part in limiting equal opportunity. Racism is a symptom of our natural tendency to be afraid of who or what we don't know. No amount of training, discussion, reform, regulation, "wokeness," or reparations will solve this issue unless there is an intrinsic desire to change. The best antidote to racism is (early) exposure and economic opportunity for all — and the path with the highest probability of success, I believe, is education. I know this firsthand, as this is my own life story. More than any affirmative action, handouts, reparations, etc. mentorship by role models — family, friends, organizations, or society — can permanently root out racism within a generation. No, police should not be defunded, but policing needs to be re-imagined. The Public Safety approach of Glencoe, where officers are cross-trained in police, fire, and EMT functions, is one worth emulating. While an officer may show up to arrest you if you cause trouble, the same officer may show up to help you if you are in trouble, which automatically engenders a level of compassion and trust, while saving costs and improving utilization and quality. Schneider: Systemic racism has been with us since our founding. While we have made significant strides to address it, often at great sacrifice, the events of this summer show there is still much to do. This summer, I attended many rallies, marches and vigils. I listened to people's stories, fears, and visions for a better America. I had many of my own assumptions challenged, and I saw first hand how important it is that we achieve real reform. A step forward was passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I was proud to help introduce and vote for this bill one month after George Floyd's murder. It ends racial profiling, bans chokeholds, and creates a national register of police misconduct so that a bad cop can't go from one jurisdiction to another. This sweeping bill would be the most significant police reform in a generation, with real change that will have a positive impact in our communities. The Senate must now act on the bill. We must also pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. I also support the establishment of a Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation to finally have the hard, but necessary, discussion of race and racism in our nation. Q: Does today's climate of polarization reflect a natural and necessary ebb and flow in the tone of civic debate? Or does it reflect a dangerous divide? What, if anything, should be done about it? Ramirez Mukherjee: No. The tone of civic debate is unusual and reflects an unnecessary and dangerous divide, which at least I have not seen before. I began my career in politics as an undergrad at UC Berkeley in the '90s in a time where we welcomed differences. I was an outsider in my political science classes — a woman, minority, first-generation, low-income college student — who embraced Republican principles. I didn't fit the stereotype of a typical Republican. But my classmates and my professors listened to me and we were all respectful of each other's views — no matter our political party. I was encouraged to speak up and share my difference of opinion, and I was never discriminated against for being a Republican. Yet, how so much has changed since 1995. Fast forward to 2019 when I stepped back in to politics after building a career in finance and tech and obtaining two Ivy League degrees and I am discriminated now on my party often. Just last week I was refused a technology product because of my political party. This is not how we used to be, and I know we can change this. I hope to be a part of that change. Schneider: Little can get done if we don't address the partisanship in our governing and find ways to bridge the gap to find common ground and sustainable solutions to our challenges. I have made fostering bipartisanship a top priority, That's why I helped create the Problem Solvers Caucus and joined the Bipartisan Working Group — to find common ground on issues including health care, immigration, and infrastructure. It is why 75 percent of my votes are with at least one Republican joining me. In fighting the Coronavirus, the Problem Solvers Caucus has become one of the few places in Congress where you can find evident bipartisan agreement. The 25 Republicans and 25 Democrats recently came together to endorse my COVID PREPARE Act to prepare for a potential resurgence of this virus. Q: What do you see as the most important issues to address regarding immigration reform? If you oppose funding for a wall, what steps do you support to try to control illegal immigration? Ramirez Mukherjee: Fortify our borders, enforce existing laws, tweak and expand legal immigration and help our neighbors. Most importantly, we need a consistent immigration policy and message that transcends administrations. Like every other country, we have the right to and must protect our borders. This could include a wall where necessary, but also natural obstacles or technology, if appropriate. Our immigration laws are well established, time tested, served us exceptionally well, and made us the envy of the world. We just need to ensure that our current laws are enforced. I support DACA, but do not believe in a path to citizenship for DREAMers, but a path to legal residency as a compassionate compromise. I believe the most durable solution to illegal immigration is to offer our neighbors — where my grandfather and stepmother are from (Mexico and El Salvador) — security and economic help to strengthen their economies and security profile so that their citizens have the option, but not the compulsion, to flee their homes. Schneider: Any attempt to end DACA was always cruel, wrong, and un-American. DREAMers are part of the fabric of our society. More than 700,000 DREAMers have received temporary relief from deportation and the ability to legally work in what is, for many, the only country and home they know. They have been a part of and contributed to our community for years. Much work remains to be done. I always have and will continue to stand up to Republican attempts to defund President Obama's executive actions on immigration and fight to make DACA permanent. I was proud to help pass the Dream and Promise Act, and I will work to pass comprehensive immigration reform and free people from living in the shadows of fear of deportation to be able to pursue higher education, buy homes, start businesses, expand our economy and fully live the American dream. I was also one of the first members of Congress to cry foul when the Trump Administration announced in July — after its initial efforts were knocked down by the Supreme Court — that it would once again attempt to roll back DACA protections. I will continue to fight for DREAMers and against the Trump Administration's wall and egregious record on immigration. Q: Is there a "cancel culture" in America? Ramirez Mukherjee: Yes, unfortunately. As a society, we tend to favor extremes and frequently swing from one extreme to another. This cancel culture has been inflamed by the 24-hour news and unchecked and anonymous social media cycles, where people are convicted in the courts of public opinion before the courts of law. Of course, egregious behavior should be punished, but we should also hear both sides of a story and provide an opportunity for nonhabitual offenders to reform and redeem themselves. Once we jump the gun, no amount of backtracking or corrections can restore reputational damage. Schneider: We need to be better at listening to each other. We need to get back to a time when we could hear others. Reasonable people can have reasonable disagreements ... and still work constructively together. The only "cancel culture" that I am interested in is canceling the gun lobby's stranglehold over many members that prevents even the most modest, widely-supported gun safety solutions from reaching the floor for a vote. The House passed H.R. 8 that would create a universal background check for all firearms transfers and sales. I was proud to be a champion for that bill. Sadly, I expect that Mitch McConnell will continue to block it. It is incredibly frustrating that so many in Congress continue to bow in fear to the National Rifle Association. I will continue to take on the NRA by uncovering their fraudulent abuses of their nonprofit status, including supporting the lawsuit to dissolve the organization. When the president of the NRA is spending millions on his own personal hobbies, homes, and yachts, it's clear that the organization is no longer a political organization, but rather a corrupt mechanism for enriching its leaders. Q: Please define your position on health care reform, especially as it relates to the Affordable Care Act. Ramirez Mukherjee: For a country as wealthy as ours, health care should be a right, not a privilege. With the extreme (and arguably, unnecessary) complexity of the issue, we will have to take an incremental approach to attain a sustainable solution. Given where we are, the best way to do so is to preserve and improve the Affordable Care Act. We can do so by leveraging lessons from the technology industry where companies constantly and voluntarily improve their products to better serve their customers. I believe the guiding principles of this approach need to include personal choice, personal responsibility, risk sharing, cost containment, expanded coverage and universal access with public and private options, where the government could be the "reinsurer" or a provider of last resort for catastrophic conditions. Schneider: A decade after passing the Affordable Care Act, so many of the problems that the law was designed to address stubbornly persist. We must recognize that rising premiums, higher deductibles, unpredictable bills, narrow networks, and lack of affordable options are all problems people still face every day. All these issues have been exacerbated by the chaos and uncertainty created by Republican attempts to dismantle, defund and defeat the ACA — in Congress and in the courts — all without any plan to replace it. Health care is, and must be treated as, a right for all, not a privilege for the fortunate few. Simply tinkering around the edges of the ACA is not sufficient to achieve this goal. One important step would be creating a "public option" — a government-sponsored health insurance plan that competes in the marketplace with private insurance. Not a forced plan, another choice for the American people. A new public plan would promote competition to drive down overall costs and return the focus more appropriately on patients and their needs. It would offer an essential alternative for the nearly 1 in 5 Americans, including my constituents living in Lake County. Q: Should everyone wear a mask? Should our schools be open? What has the country done right about the pandemic? What has it done wrong? How optimistic are you that we'll ever get back to "normal"? Ramirez Mukherjee: Masks: yes. Schools: It depends. Acknowledging the gravity of the problem, developing a suitable response and guidelines to combat the pandemic as we learned more based on science and data was the right thing to do. Inconsistent standards across states, and a lack of examples in the "fog of war" that inadvertently led to politicizing and inconsistent enforcement of the response was the wrong thing to do. Yes, we will get back to normal, but I predict it may take another year, maybe two. Schneider: Before we can get our economy on the path to full recovery and safely reopen schools, we have to effectively beat back the virus. That will require everyone doing their part, including wearing a mask. Meanwhile, to put the economy in the best position to fully recover and once again grow, we need to help our nation — American working families, small businesses, health care providers, state and local governments — navigate this period until we get either therapeutics or a cure. The HEROES Act the House passed in May had the solution to defeating the virus and safely reopening our economy. In a new pandemic relief bill, I am fighting for a second round of $1,200 direct checks to individuals, expanded assistance for small businesses, more money for testing and contact tracing, and extended unemployment benefits to keep Illinois families above water. We also need significant funding for state and local governments to support schools, front-line medical professionals and first responders — many of which have been brought to the brink by this crisis. Q: What do you consider America's role in world affairs? What are we doing correctly to fill that role? What else should we be doing? Ramirez Mukherjee: America is the shining moral light of the world. We have rightly built strong military and commercial alliances and are able exert tremendous economic and soft power globally. This has, and will continue, to help us in the future as the world continues to coalesce and globalize. The U.S. accounts for only 5 percent of the global population, but 25 percent of world GDP, two thirds of which is U.S. consumer spending. With an aging population, and growth rates below replacement, it is in our interest to build on this advantage now and help countries emerge from poverty so that they can become markets for our goods and services. It is imperative that we maintain our moral, economic and military position in the world and do so with "free" soft power than "expensive" military interventions and continue to lead by example. Schneider: As a former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and still with keen interest in the area, I support policies that preserve the United States' positive influence and leadership in relations with our allies, in addressing challenges with our adversaries, and in helping set international policies in global forums. Our goal in foreign policy must always be to keep America safe today, as well as work to craft a sustainable, forward-looking policy that can ensure our security and prosperity for years to come. As the international system continues to evolve from the bipolar world of the last half-century to one of multiple influential powers, the U.S. must also continue to combine a strategic defense policy with diplomacy and development. At the same time, we must focus on sustaining and enhancing our economic strength, as stability at home will translate into continued influence and investment overseas. Q: Do you believe climate change is caused by human activity? What steps should government be taking to address the issue? Ramirez Mukherjee: Yes. The science underlying climate change is alarming. I have traveled to several Third World countries and experienced firsthand the real effects of lax government policies. I couldn't breathe — the smells, the exhaust, the pollution — it was something that I had never experienced before. That changed my view on climate change. Science tells us that we are reaching a point of irreversible damage, and the government should acknowledge and address this problem urgently. If we don't act now, climate change is going to have an impact that is far worse than the pandemic. I believe the approach to address the issue should be commercial and incentive-based rather than punitive and regulatory, to ensure that efforts are focused on sustainable solutions rather than workarounds to regulation. Schneider: I believe the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate-warming trends over the past century have been caused by human activity. In the long-term, climate change is among the most serious issues we face, and it poses a direct threat to our children's future. First and foremost, I support reversing the damage caused by President Trump's policies weakening environmental protections and decision to abandon the Paris Climate Agreement. I also support restoring the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and allowing the EPA to regulate carbon emissions as it does other pollutants. More long-term, we must continue to support the transition to renewable sources of energy, including solar, wind, and geothermal, and lower our greenhouse gas emissions. We must help the U.S. economy to become more energy efficient, support community investments in green infrastructure, and prepare federal and state programs to meet the challenge of climate-driven natural disasters — like the increased flooding we've seen in our own community. There is no better example of the direct threat of climate change than the rising water levels we see in Lake Michigan. Q: What role does Congress play with regards to the growth of conspiracy theory groups like QAnon? Ramirez Mukherjee: Conspiracy theories are not new. What is new is the speed with which these theories can be spread that result in deadly consequences. Congress can play a role in controlling the spread of conspiracy theories, but has to do so gently and under a different context, given the fine line between free speech and such theories. The context could be, for example, forging our response to the two most serious national security threats: biological and cyber. Regardless of its origin, whether man made or natural, the pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world. There will likely be more. Similarly, cyber warfare, that includes commercial espionage, infrastructure sabotage, election interference and disinformation campaigns, among others, are more pressing than conventional or nuclear warfare. Congress could expand the remit and funding to improve our cyber defenses and/or establish standards to counter conspiracy theories instead of trampling on free speech rights. Schneider: Congress must lead with the facts. Whether regarding the reality of the pandemic or corruption of the Trump Administration, we cannot allow our work to be derailed by conspiracy theories. The most significant development in ending this conspiracy theory would be having a President who would come out and forcefully condemn it. Another important role for Congress is passing legislation dealing with the threat of groups like QAnon. My bill, The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020, would be a significant step. It aims to improve the government's prevention, reporting, response, and investigation of domestic terrorism, including incidences linked to white supremacy, by authorizing three offices, one each within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the FBI, to monitor, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism. The offices will provide Congress joint biannual reports assessing the state of domestic terrorism threats. Based on the data collected, the bill requires these offices to focus their resources on the most significant threats, which will be described in detail in the joint biannual report.

Hundreds of District 54 students wrapped up weeks of design work at the annual Rocketry Club Rocket Launch on June 8 and 9, at Olympic Park in Schaumburg.
This school year, District 54 has expanded science, technology, engineering and math opportunities for students.
Few STEM topics generate as much excitement as rockets.
The scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical foundations of rocketry provide exciting opportunities for authentic hands-on experimentation.
In September, 500 students began the exploration of aerospace engineering through the NASA Rockets curriculum as part of Rocketry Clubs at 27 schools.
The activities emphasized hands-on science, prediction, data collection and interpretation, teamwork, and problem solving, and provided students with background information about the history of rockets and basic rocket science.
The students constructed their own rockets and had the opportunity to apply their rocketry expertise at the Rocket Launch.

What TV viewers should know about following election night returns

Whether it was CNN beaming holograms of its far-flung correspondents onto the set, or Dan Rather's folksy play-by-play ("This race is shakier than cafeteria Jello"), election night was once an occasion that TV news greeted with giddy, self-promoting flair. Not this year. Amid projected historic turnout — and historic national anxiety — media organizations plan to strike a more somber, deliberate tone. They will contend with staffs dispersed by the coronavirus shutdown, ballot-counting rituals upended by a tsunami of early and mail-in votes, and a polarized climate in which President Donald Trump has attempted to sow doubt about the integrity of the process. In conversations over the past week, top officials at ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and The Associated Press answered our questions about following the election results with them this year. 
* * * Should viewers expect to have a result of the election on Nov. 4? Nobody knows, and news executives say they are prepared for the potential of the count going on well into the next day — or beyond. "Obviously, there's a strong possibility that we won't be able to project the winner" on Tuesday, said James Goldston, ABC News president. News directors say they have run dress rehearsals with their data scientists, statisticians and on-air talent to prepare for every eventuality of how election night might unfold — and now, says CBS News President Susan Zirinsky, "we have to prepare the audience: It may not be over that night, it may take days." Which is why "we have no illusion of going off the air," said Marc Burstein, a senior executive producer at ABC. "We've told everybody not to plan on going home, and then we'll come back to do it on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday." * * * What's changed since the last presidential election? Many television news anchors appeared visibly shocked on election night 2016 as the vote tallies that would propel Donald Trump into the White House rolled in from across the country. That misreading chastened the whole industry. This year, "we aren't going in with any narrative or set of expectations," said Noah Oppenheim, president of NBC News. "We are going to talk about the facts and not get ahead of them." To remind his staff to be cautious and prepared, CNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist distributed copies of the testimony news executives gave to Congress when they were called to explain how the television networks got things so wrong in 2000 — the night they called Florida for Gore, then for Bush, then realized it was too close to call. * * * How will the networks get their information on how the vote is going throughout the night? As they have for nearly two decades, the big three broadcast networks and CNN will join as the National Election Pool to share data collected by a firm called Edison Research, which conducts exit polls — via both in-person and phone surveys of people who have already voted — to anticipate the trends within this year's electorate. While "a handful of people at each network" will be permitted to review the exit-poll data during the day, they will not be allowed to report it until 5 p.m. Tuesday, said Edison executive Joe Lenski. Edison also will collect the actual vote tallies from across the country as they are released by local jurisdictions. But Fox News and the AP left the pool after 2016 and have struck out together, hiring a research operation affiliated with the University of Chicago to help them prepare their projections. Arnon Mishkin, head of Fox's decision desk, said his organization was disappointed with 2016's exit polling, which skewed the results by capturing a disproportionate number of younger and college-educated voters — many of whom lean Democratic — and didn't fully probe the voting sentiment of mail-in and early voters. What this means is that for the first time since 1988, you'll see not one but two different polls of the electorate as you flip the channels. * * * How will the huge number of mail-in votes affect election night coverage? In past years, viewers were accustomed to hearing reports about the growing vote tally, tracked by the "percentage of precincts reporting," which enhanced the illusion of a steadily moving horse race. But what goes on in the precincts is more abstract this year, thanks to the large number of mail-in votes — many of which won't be calculated until after the in-person vote. So news executives promise they will explain the vote tally in its full context at every step. "You'll hear about Election Day in-person voting. You will hear about preelection in-person voting. And you will hear about mail-in voting," said David Chalian, CNN's political director. Those distinctions are important, networks say, because each cohort is expected to skew in different directions. Expect to hear television anchors to frame the results in terms of "percentage of the expected vote" instead of the "percentage of precincts reporting." * * * What's this talk about a "red mirage" or a "blue mirage"? Preelection opinion surveys have showed that this year, Democrats have a much greater propensity to vote by mail than Republicans. So depending on when a state plans to tally its mail-in ballots, there could be big swerves in the results throughout the evening. "We have to explain to the viewer what we know about those vote totals, because it could help them understand why a state may appear red initially on the map, but we believe that it may shift blue and that you shouldn't be surprised by that and vice versa," said Chalian. For example, said Fox News's Mishkin, there are two states where people are most likely to "draw inappropriate conclusions" — Florida, which will count its early votes first, possibly making it seem deceptively blue in the early hours, and Pennsylvania, where Election Day votes are counted first, possibly making it seem deceptively red until all the early and mail-in ballots are cast. * * * Why does it even matter what the networks project on election night? In 1980, NBC News used exit polling data to call the state of California for Ronald Reagan early in the evening, and Jimmy Carter conceded the election before the state's polls had closed, which hurt other Democratic candidates in the Pacific time zone when those voters didn't bother to show up. In 2000, based on vote and polling information from a now-abandoned research firm, the networks made the premature botched calls about Florida. The Associated Press was notably alone in saying it could not make a call based on the vote that night. But the contradictory calls on network television helped fuel confusion through the ensuing recount. This year, "being right is of absolute importance, and being first is less so," said Oppenheim. "We have a tremendous responsibility election night and this year more than ever. Everything we report needs to be bulletproof." * * * How will the networks call the race? The anchors may be the voice of authority in delivering the news, but it's not up to them to make the call. Each network relies on an in-house staff typically called a "decision desk" — a cadre of experts in data science and political science who look at historical voting patterns and compare them to real-time data as the vote comes in. They sit apart from the anchors and analysts you see on air. In 2012, when guest commentator Karl Rove disputed Fox's decision to call Ohio for Barack Obama, then-anchor Megyn Kelly had the cameras follow her down the hall to get Mishkin to explain his projections. Mishkin stood his ground and was soon proved right. (All the networks tout the independence of their decision desks, but in 2000, Fox's was run by John Ellis, who spent time on the phone that night sharing observations with his cousins — then-candidate George W. Bush and then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush — and prematurely called Florida for Bush even before the other networks. Fox says that its present-day decision desk doesn't have contact with campaigns.) This year, expect the announcements to come with a dose of math homework, as news organizations plan to show their work. "Every time we call a state for one of the two candidates, we are going to do a small but robust piece of explanatory journalism that we will put out as fast as possible to explain why the AP called that race," said Associated Press Executive Editor Sally Buzbee. "This isn't magic. It's math and analysis." And editors are vowing a "99.5% certainty" behind each call. "We do not call a race until we are absolutely sure that there is no way the trailing candidate can catch up," added Buzbee. One added potential for drama is the somewhat different data that AP and Fox will be working with, apart from the National Election Pool networks, since the two sets of pollsters will work with different sets of questions. "The public will be well-served by the fact that there are two entities conducting that poll," Mishkin said. * * * What will the media do if Trump attempts to declare victory prematurely, as some have speculated he might? Network executives did not explicitly say whether they would air such a speech or not; instead, they promise to report the most accurate news about what's going on, no matter what one of the candidates says. "Our job is to bring facts and context to those facts on election night," said CNN's Chalian. "Votes are facts. If someone declares victory prior to receiving 270 electoral votes and prior to CNN being able to project a winner, we will make sure to make those facts clear to the audience as we do each and every day." * * * How are the networks going to fill all those hours if the vote takes a long time? It's possible that you'll be watching the equivalent of a televised civics class. This year, you can expect the news to go deep on the processes behind mail-in voting, the mechanics of the electoral college, what happens in the case of a tie, the expectations for a peaceful transfer of power and so forth. And as they deliver news, they promise they'll do everything they can to explain where it came from, how they got it, and what it means. "When the hour comes, and the polls close, we are going to characterize every state that has closed: likely, leaning tossup, late-in-the night call," said Zirinsky of CBS. "But what we have to maintain very clearly to the audience is what we know, how we know it. We're educating the public on how we are making this assessment."

Panel: First vaccines to health staffs

The first doses of a coronavirus vaccine should be given to an estimated 21 million health care workers and 3 million residents and staffers of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, a federal advisory panel recommended Tuesday afternoon. These groups were deemed the highest priority by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices because the vaccine will initially be in extremely short supply after it is cleared by federal regulators. Health care personnel are a top priority because of their exposure to the virus and their critical role in keeping the nation's hospitals and clinics functioning. Residents and employees of long-term care facilities were prioritized because they account for nearly 40% of deaths linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
The recommendations for the highest priority groups, known as phase 1a, will be sent to CDC Director Robert Redfield, who also informs Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. If the recommendations are approved, they will become official CDC recommendations on immunization in the United States and provide official guidance to state officials, who are working to meet a Friday deadline for vaccine-distribution planning. The committee voted 13 to 1 to prioritize the two groups. Helen Keipp Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University, was the sole dissenting vote. Unease over the recommendations centered on the inclusion of long-term-care residents, with several panel members saying there was insufficient vaccine safety and efficacy data to support immunizing that population right away. Talbot said safety monitoring of people who have gotten the shots in these settings is inadequate. "We hope it works, and we hope it's safe," she said of the vaccine. Other members said they were reassured by the support of the recommendation from geriatric medicine specialists. Beth Bell, a global health expert at the University of Washington who chairs the panel's coronavirus vaccine work group, said the vote was coming at "a particularly difficult time" in the pandemic. "There is an average of one COVID death per minute right now," she said. During the three-hour meeting, she said, 180 people "will have died from COVID-19, so we are acting none too soon." The advisory group will make recommendations at later meetings for priority groups in the next phases, which include essential workers and older adults. A union representing 1.3 million food and retail workers — the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union — urged the CDC on Tuesday evening to prioritize workers in grocery, meatpacking and food processing for the next round, citing the thousands who have already died. What the committee will recommend may differ from what some Trump administration officials want, according to three federal health officials. Redfield; Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force; and Adm. Brett Giroir, the top testing official at the Department of Health and Human Services, have recently emphasized the importance of prioritizing older Americans, whereas the committee members have held firm on giving preference to health care workers. Michael Pratt, an HHS spokesman, said Azar is committed to following the process and "has insisted that science and data drive the process for vaccines and therapeutic development, and will do so for vaccine allocation and distribution." He added: "Doctors will make their recommendations, and ultimately the governors will make a determination of what works best for their communities based on input they receive and the circumstances on the ground." U.S. officials anticipate having about 40 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer and biotech firm Moderna by the end of the year, enough to immunize 20 million people, a fraction of the U.S. population of 330 million. Operation Warp Speed, the administration's initiative to speed vaccine and therapeutics development, plans to send the first batch of 6.4 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine to communities nationwide within 24 hours of FDA clearance, with the expectation that shots will be administered quickly. But because of the limited doses, the panel's work group suggested that health care systems prioritize their personnel even further. They might do that by staggering vaccinations by individual units — such as emergency departments — and giving vaccine first to those with direct patient contact and those who handle infectious material, and to personnel who provide services to patients or their families. CDC officials said they anticipate that most of the estimated 40 million doses will be distributed by the end of December. After that, 5 million to 10 million doses of vaccine are expected to be sent out each week. Nancy Messonnier, the top official overseeing distribution at CDC, said her talks with states and local officials suggest that most intend to vaccinate all their health care workers within three weeks of getting vaccine.

The time has come for an answer to the question about high school sports: How long do you hit the pause button before you push play, fast-forward or stop? With Feb. 13 looming as the final day for the winter sports season that has yet to begin, we asked IHSA executive director Craig Anderson Wednesday how long the IHSA can wait before conceding the winter season isn't going to happen. 
Illinois High School Association and Illinois Elementary School Association leaders met with Deputy Gov. Jesse Ruiz and Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike on Wednesday evening via Zoom. "It's fair to say that once we get into January, where we don't have anything underway, it becomes a concern as to the timeline available for the current winter, spring and summer seasons," Anderson said. "Some things will have to come to a stop and some seasons won't be played. Our board has been committed to some sort of season in all sports but the clock is ticking." The return to sports is clearly in the hands of the IDPH and the governor's office. The IHSA tried in November to go ahead with a winter season, against public health guidelines. While it may have been a noble gesture, it was quickly shot down as school districts were told the liability would be too great. And as Tier 3 mitigations remain in place, high school sports remain on pause. On Wednesday, the IHSA asked the IDPH to "review the risk levels of all remaining sports, with consideration for lowering some sports from their current risk levels." "We believe that there is both data and science that validates the idea that we can safely conduct sports," IHSA Executive Director Craig Anderson said. "We have seen it work in other states and believe it can in Illinois if we utilize the mitigations provided by IDPH and the IHSA SMAC. "Students are already leaving or participating out-of-state on weekends. We believe that competing for their high school remains the safest venue for participation." With COVID-19 case numbers rising again, it seems likely there will not be a winter season as currently scheduled. "We're still not engaged in any activities. The life lessons and all the benefits that come from that are being taken away. All of that hits heavy for me and so many others."

I know that I want to make a positive impact." Sponsor's endorsement: "Curious, thorough and authentic are words used to describe Alexa. But that is not all of Alexa. She is also empathetic and real. She understands the need for human connections and has worked at not getting lost in her academics, expectations and perfectionism. Alexa is perpetually nice, even while needing to correct a teacher or peer on wrong information. Other students thrive in groups with Alexa." Sarah Sobol, Lake Zurich High School Hometown: Lake Zurich Parents: Paul Sobol and Cydney Sobol Sponsor: Meghan Wood, counselor GPA: 5.1958 on a weighted 4.0 scale Test scores: ACT: 36; SAT: 1580 Planned major: Chemical engineering; with biotechnology and biochemical engineering minors Awards, honors: National Merit Finalist; AP Scholar with Distinction; Illinois State Scholar Personal statement: "I realized through tutoring other students that I want to be able to make an impact on the people around me.

Angela Zhang, Stevenson High School Hometown: Long Grove Parents: Liming Zhang, Yun Cao Sponsor: Keith Hannigan, history teacher GPA: 4.83 on a weighted 4.0 scale Test scores: SAT, 1570 combined Planned major: Mathematics Awards, honors: M3 Challenge finalist; National Physics Olympiad semifinalist; three-time AIME qualifier Personal statement: "In junior year, my math team coach introduced the M3 Challenge, a 14-hour competition using mathematical modeling to solve a real-world problem. As captain, I led our team in creating a multivariate model for feeding the food-insecure population in Texas with repurposed food waste; validated the model with pre-existing data; and evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of our solution. It was my first exposure to mathematical modeling and applied mathematics." Sponsor's endorsement: "Angela's achievements are so deep and accomplished with such apparent ease, the normal narrative does not apply. I worry that reciting all her qualities and awards will sound hollow. Surely, you will think, she can't really be that great. Actually ... she is."

In high school, earning A's in three AP science courses (Physics C, Chemistry, Biology) in one year is considered nearly impossible, but I loved the challenge. I've expanded beyond the classroom to pursue advanced topics in science by participating in the USA math, physics, chemistry, and biology Olympiads." Sponsor's endorsement: "I was talking with our Science Department Chair this morning about Kevin, and we decided that he is one of the top three students we have ever encountered. He possesses an intellectual curiosity coupled with a natural confidence that I have never encountered before." 
Carissa N. Lehning, Elk Grove High School Hometown: Elk Grove Village Parents: Frances and Richard Lehning Sponsor: Colin Rice, chemistry teacher Test scores: ACT: 36; SAT: 1570 Planned major: Chemistry Awards, honors: Voice of Democracy, third place in District 214; National French Contest, sixth place; Speech Team, ninth place in state in radio category Personal statement: "I plan to major in chemistry. I'll admit that I don't know exactly what I'm going to do with that degree; however, I've always been interested in materials science, and while I learn about the materials themselves in chemistry, I learn about their applications in engineering. Regardless of whether I'm on a stage or in a lab, whether I'm working on the next rocket to Mars or a soil reclamation project, in English or in French, I will do something fantastic and make a difference in the world." Sponsor's endorsement: "Carissa has shown a strong passion for chemistry. She is an extremely hard worker, and always asks thought-provoking questions to seek deeper understanding of the content matter. Carissa is willing to explain, tutor or help explain concepts to her classmates." John McDonough, John Hersey High School Hometown: Arlington Heights Parents: Paul and Marianna McDonough Sponsor: Kent Borghoff, Social Science teacher GPA: 4.67 on a weighted 4.0 scale Test scores: ACT: 36 Planned major: Economics and Russian Awards, honors: Presidential Scholar Candidate, National Merit Finalist, AP Scholar Personal statement: "In thinking about my high school achievements and their connection to my life goals, I realized that all of the auxiliary goals in my life could be summed up under one overarching goal: to exercise my God-given talents to the best of my ability, no matter the situation." Sponsor's endorsement: "I first worked with John when he was a sophomore on the varsity Scholastic Bowl team that I coached. He was the only sophomore on the varsity team and his extensive knowledge of history, geography, and current events enabled him to respond to the most challenging questions against the most elite academic competition throughout the Northwest suburban area." Bhagirath Mehta, Maine West High School Hometown: Des Plaines Parents: Prashant and Pragna Mehta Sponsor: Audrey Haugan GPA: 4.96 on a weighted 4.0 scale Test scores: ACT: 36; SAT: 1580 Planned major: Computer Science, Linguistics Awards, honors: First Place in Math Kangaroo International Math Competiton, AP Scholar, National Merit Finalist Personal statement: "This past summer, I ran a coding camp, #HelloWorldBootCamp, for future Maine West students, teaching them programming in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make websites on a topic of social good. I was later invited by Argonne National Lab to teach senior scientists to make websites." Sponsor's endorsement: "Bhagirath has been coming to high school since sixth grade, when his junior high ran out of classes for him to take there. He started with Accelerated Math Analysis as a sixth-grader, moving on to Geometry and Trigonometry Accelerated in seventh grade, and AP Calculus BC in eighth grade. He received all A's in those classes, where he sat among high school juniors and seniors." Uma Pradeepan, Schaumburg High School Hometown: Schaumburg Parents: Rajasree Ellath and Pradeepan Kunhiraman Sponsor: Brent Swolsky, Counselor GPA: 5.105 on a weighted 4.0 scale Test scores: ACT: 35; SAT: 1580 Planned major: Computer science Awards, honors: Math Team: ICTM State, AP Scholar, Illinois State Scholar Personal statement: "The reason why I want to major in computer science, besides my love for thinking critically through abstract mathematical problems, is because it enables me to fulfill my purpose of connecting people with knowledge. The data which computer scientists manage is the same information which people in certain specializations treasure so dearly. I despise the idea of so many individuals' brain power and efforts going to waste, which is why, as my skill sets as a Computer Science major grow, I want to help facilitate the sharing of knowledge." Sponsor's endorsement: "Uma's strength as an individual is in her desire to expand her learning beyond the traditional classroom. One of Uma's most notable accomplishments came during the summer of 2017, as she earned an internship with the Chicago Field Museum." Hari Ramakrishnan, Barrington High School Hometown: Lake Barrington Parents: Lakshmi and Subramanian Ramakrishnan Sponsor: Timothy Martin, counselor GPA: 4.802 on a weighted 4.0 scale Test scores: ACT: 36; SAT: 1600 Planned major: Engineering Awards, honors: One of four projects presented at 2016 National Project Lead the Way Summit, 2017 AP Microeconomics Exam Perfect Score, National French Contest Silver Medal, National Merit Finalist, Illinois State Scholar Personal statement: "My experiences volunteering at Citizens for Conservation brought me closer to the nature in my local community, but also to the problems that humans bring to their environment. I wanted to explore these problems and their connections to global environmental issues, so I sought out summer research opportunities in the environmental science field." Sponsor's endorsement: "Hari Ramakrishnan is one of the most remarkable students I have had in all of my years in education. As impressive as his academic achievements are, I really think his emotional intelligence level is even more remarkable." Megha Ramanathan, Hoffman Estates High School Hometown: Hoffman Estates Parents: Balaji Ramanathan and Krithika Ramanathan Sponsor: Heidi E. Davey, English teacher GPA: 5.057 on a weighted 4.0 scale Test scores: SAT: 1520 Planned major: Computer science Awards, honors: National Merit Finalist, AP Scholar, Richard C. Kolze Achievement Award Personal statement: "My goal is to contribute to society in a meaningful way through the use of technology and computer programming, as well as to simply appreciate and nurture the natural curiosity and passion that I have for puzzles, big and small." Sponsor's endorsement: "There is much that comes easily to this student as far as an instantaneous grasp of what is relevant, moving, or otherwise interesting, but you would not know this from the incredible work ethic that is demonstrated daily. She could do a more superficial or cursory approach to assignments and still more than meet standards for mastery and A-earning, but she never does. The depth and precision of every assignment is amazing." Nitinshankar Subramanian, James B. Conant High School Hometown: Elk Grove Village Parents: Subramanian Sankaran and Nirmala Subramanian Sponsor: Matt Wiley, counselor GPA: 3.977 on a traditional 4.0 scale Test scores: ACT: 36; SAT: 1590 Planned major: Data science Awards, honors: National Merit Finalist, Illinois State Scholar, Debate State Champion Personal statement: "During the winter of my junior year, I started to contact college football and basketball teams about doing analytical work for them. I sent email after email, but was met with rejection after rejection. Finally, Northwestern — my 10th attempt at connecting with a program — offered me an internship. My experience provided me an unparalleled opportunity to learn and experiment at a big-time sports institution." Sponsor's endorsement: "Nitin has been selected to be on the Illinois School Board of Education Student Council, a position that he takes very seriously. Nitin founded a tutoring organization that has raised over $2,000 to educate children in his family's native country of India — an incredible philanthropic feat." Jeremy Yoder, St. Viator High School Hometown: Buffalo Grove Parents: Dennis and Michelle Yoder Sponsor: Stephanie Spiewak GPA: 105.39 on weighted 100 point scale Test scores: ACT: 35; SAT: 1540 Planned major: Business, data analytics Awards, honors: Salutatorian, National Merit Finalist, Vicariate Youth Leadership Award Personal statement: "I don't live for school; I live for people. I live to connect with them, to feel their pain, to ease their struggles, and what this says of my motives could not be more telling of my goals. I long for so much more in life than academic achievement. I am neither afraid of hard work nor a stranger to it, but I simply want so much more from this world. Whatever my degree, whatever my path, I will always be in the business of caring for others." Sponsor's endorsement: "Jeremy is a student who could be considered ‘the face of Saint Viator.' One could say he is the total package — intelligent, school spirit, mature and extremely humble. It would be easy for some students to be jealous of the type of student Jeremy is, however, he is most respected among his peers." Allison Zhang, James B. Conant High School Hometown: Schaumburg Parents: Janet Gao and Heng Zhang Sponsor: Matt Wiley, Counselor GPA: 5.0 on a weighted 4.0 scale Test scores: ACT: 36; SAT: 1580 Planned major: Applied mathematics, economics Awards, honors: National Merit Scholar, AP Scholar, Illinois State Scholar Personal statement: "My dream is to work in finance or investment banking, both careers which require a strong mathematical foundation and a perception of economic behavior. Each decision is a balance of risk and reward, with consequences for each action taken. Through this process, I hope to become a role model for young girls who are looking to pursue a degree in mathematics to prove to them that women can still make an impact in a male-dominated field." Sponsor's endorsement: "Allison's contributions to the school do not stop in academics and music, she also has been a strong team member on our lacrosse team for the entirety of her high school career. One would be hard-pressed to find a student as well-rounded and successful as Allison."

Republican Valerie Ramirez Mukherjee of Northbrook is running against incumbent Democrat Brad Schneider in the 10th Congressional District. Q: What has Donald Trump's unconventional leadership taught us about politics in the United States? What is the best thing his presidency has done? What is the most significant criticism you have of it? A: In politics, like everything else in life, both action and words matter. 
President Trump's disruption of the political status quo and economic policy successes are undeniable, but his rhetoric is untenable. Until the pandemic, his economic policies had positively impacted every segment of American society, and his disruption put both allies and enemies that took us for granted on notice. While the straight talk and irreverence for political correctness are refreshing, the singular focus on the economy, even when faced with hard science and data to do otherwise when confronting a pandemic, was ill-advised. The dual impacts of the pandemic and rhetoric have exposed latent feelings and attitudes and unnecessarily politicized the issue. This was a missed opportunity to lead by example. Q: Many critics of governmental process complain that both Barack Obama and Donald Trump governed too much through executive orders rather than in collaboration with Congress. Is our system in danger of veering toward authoritarianism? From a structural standpoint, does Congress need to place stronger limits on the power of the presidency? If so, be specific on what some of those limits might be. If not, please explain your view. A: Presidents would not have to use executive orders if Congress did their job, and no, Congress does not need to limit Presidential powers. Executive orders are a symptom, not the cause, of the extreme polarization of politics and misguided focus in Congress. For example, Congressman Schneider has been in office for six years and raised almost $20,000,000 to get elected. What are his results? Nothing. Zero of his sponsored bills have become law, yet during that time 624 laws sponsored by his peers have become laws. So he is six years, $20,000,000 raised, and 0 of 624. He's not alone, though. You have performers and underperformers just like you would in any industry. But the difference is in Congress the underperformers get away with it if they can be a star fundraiser — like Congressman Schneider and his low performing peers who chair the Democratic fundraising arm with him — another Illinois member of Congress. The media tends to focus on fundraising quarterly rather than publishing who is getting stuff done. And our voters suffer the consequences of that. If we change our attention to results, I think we could change the effectiveness of Congress rather quickly. Q: Protesters have massed in the streets throughout America calling for greater social justice. How significant a role does systemic racism play in limiting equal opportunity in America? To the degree that it exists, what should be done about it? Do you favor reparations? Should police be "defunded"? A: Racism, whether systematic, inadvertent, or latent, does play a part in limiting equal opportunity. Racism is a symptom of our natural tendency to be afraid of who or what we don't know. No amount of training, discussion, reform, regulation, "wokeness," or reparations will solve this issue unless there is an intrinsic desire to change. The best antidote to racism is (early) exposure and economic opportunity for all — and the path with the highest probability of success, I believe, is education. I know this firsthand, as this is my own life story. More than any affirmative action, handouts, reparations, etc. mentorship by role models — family, friends, organizations, or society — can permanently root out racism within a generation. No, police should not be defunded, but policing needs to be re-imagined. The Public Safety approach of Glencoe, where officers are cross-trained in police, fire, and EMT functions, is one worth emulating. While an officer may show up to arrest you if you cause trouble, the same officer may show up to help you if you are in trouble, which automatically engenders a level of compassion and trust, while saving costs and improving utilization and quality. Q: Does today's climate of polarization reflect a natural and necessary ebb and flow in the tone of civic debate? Or does it reflect a dangerous divide? What, if anything, should be done about it? A: No. The tone of civic debate is unusual and reflects an unnecessary and dangerous divide, which at least I have not seen before. I began my career in politics as an undergrad at UC Berkeley in the '90s in a time where we welcomed differences. I was an outsider in my political science classes — a woman, minority, first-generation, low-income college student — who embraced Republican principles. I didn't fit the stereotype of a typical Republican. But my classmates and my professors listened to me and we were all respectful of each other's views — no matter our political party. I was encouraged to speak up and share my difference of opinion, and I was never discriminated against for being a Republican. Yet, how so much has changed since 1995. Fast forward to 2019 when I stepped back in to politics after building a career in finance and tech and obtaining two Ivy League degrees and I am discriminated now on my party often. Just last week I was refused a technology product because of my political party. This is not how we used to be, and I know we can change this. I hope to be a part of that change. Q: Is there a "cancel culture" in America? A: Yes, unfortunately. As a society, we tend to favor extremes and frequently swing from one extreme to another. This cancel culture has been inflamed by the 24-hour news and unchecked and anonymous social media cycles, where people are convicted in the courts of public opinion before the courts of law. Of course, egregious behavior should be punished, but we should also hear both sides of a story and provide an opportunity for nonhabitual offenders to reform and redeem themselves. Once we jump the gun, no amount of backtracking or corrections can restore reputational damage. Q: What do you see as the most important issues to address regarding immigration reform? If you oppose funding for a wall, what steps do you support to try to control illegal immigration? A: Fortify our borders, enforce existing laws, tweak and expand legal immigration and help our neighbors. Most importantly, we need a consistent immigration policy and message that transcends administrations. Like every other country, we have the right to and must protect our borders. This could include a wall where necessary, but also natural obstacles or technology, if appropriate. Our immigration laws are well established, time tested, served us exceptionally well, and made us the envy of the world. We just need to ensure that our current laws are enforced. I support DACA, but do not believe in a path to citizenship for DREAMers, but a path to legal residency as a compassionate compromise. I believe the most durable solution to illegal immigration is to offer our neighbors — where my grandfather and stepmother are from (Mexico and El Salvador) — security and economic help to strengthen their economies and security profile so that their citizens have the option, but not the compulsion, to flee their homes. Q: Please define your position on health care reform, especially as it relates to the Affordable Care Act. A: For a country as wealthy as ours, health care should be a right, not a privilege. With the extreme (and arguably, unnecessary) complexity of the issue, we will have to take an incremental approach to attain a sustainable solution. Given where we are, the best way to do so is to preserve and improve the Affordable Care Act. We can do so by leveraging lessons from the technology industry where companies constantly and voluntarily improve their products to better serve their customers. I believe the guiding principles of this approach need to include personal choice, personal responsibility, risk sharing, cost containment, expanded coverage and universal access with public and private options, where the government could be the "reinsurer" or a provider of last resort for catastrophic conditions. Q: Should everyone wear a mask? Should our schools be open? What has the country done right about the pandemic? What has it done wrong? How optimistic are you that we'll ever get back to "normal"? A: Masks: yes. Schools: It depends. Acknowledging the gravity of the problem, developing a suitable response and guidelines to combat the pandemic as we learned more based on science and data was the right thing to do. Inconsistent standards across states, and a lack of examples in the "fog of war" that inadvertently led to politicizing and inconsistent enforcement of the response was the wrong thing to do. Yes, we will get back to normal, but I predict it may take another year, maybe two. Q: What do you consider America's role in world affairs? What are we doing correctly to fill that role? What else should we be doing? A: America is the shining moral light of the world. We have rightly built strong military and commercial alliances and are able exert tremendous economic and soft power globally. This has, and will continue, to help us in the future as the world continues to coalesce and globalize. The U.S. accounts for only 5 percent of the global population, but 25 percent of world GDP, two thirds of which is U.S. consumer spending. With an aging population, and growth rates below replacement, it is in our interest to build on this advantage now and help countries emerge from poverty so that they can become markets for our goods and services. It is imperative that we maintain our moral, economic and military position in the world and do so with "free" soft power than "expensive" military interventions and continue to lead by example. Q: Do you believe climate change is caused by human activity? What steps should government be taking to address the issue? A: Yes. The science underlying climate change is alarming. I have traveled to several Third World countries and experienced firsthand the real effects of lax government policies. I couldn't breathe — the smells, the exhaust, the pollution — it was something that I had never experienced before. That changed my view on climate change. Science tells us that we are reaching a point of irreversible damage, and the government should acknowledge and address this problem urgently. If we don't act now, climate change is going to have an impact that is far worse than the pandemic. I believe the approach to address the issue should be commercial and incentive-based rather than punitive and regulatory, to ensure that efforts are focused on sustainable solutions rather than workarounds to regulation. Q: What role does Congress play with regards to the growth of conspiracy theory groups like QAnon? A: Conspiracy theories are not new. What is new is the speed with which these theories can be spread that result in deadly consequences. Congress can play a role in controlling the spread of conspiracy theories, but has to do so gently and under a different context, given the fine line between free speech and such theories. The context could be, for example, forging our response to the two most serious national security threats: biological and cyber. Regardless of its origin, whether man made or natural, the pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world. There will likely be more. Similarly, cyber warfare, that includes commercial espionage, infrastructure sabotage, election interference and disinformation campaigns, among others, are more pressing than conventional or nuclear warfare. Congress could expand the remit and funding to improve our cyber defenses and/or establish standards to counter conspiracy theories instead of trampling on free speech rights.

Q: What has Donald Trump's unconventional leadership taught us about politics in the United States? What is the best thing his presidency has done? What is the most significant criticism you have of it? A: In politics, like everything else in life, both action and words matter. President Trump's disruption of the political status quo and economic policy successes are undeniable, but his rhetoric is untenable. 
Until the pandemic, his economic policies had positively impacted every segment of American society, and his disruption put both allies and enemies that took us for granted on notice. While the straight talk and irreverence for political correctness are refreshing, the singular focus on the economy, even when faced with hard science and data to do otherwise when confronting a pandemic, was ill-advised. The dual impacts of the pandemic and rhetoric have exposed latent feelings and attitudes and unnecessarily politicized the issue. This was a missed opportunity to lead by example. Q: Many critics of governmental process complain that both Barack Obama and Donald Trump governed too much through executive orders rather than in collaboration with Congress. Is our system in danger of veering toward authoritarianism? From a structural standpoint, does Congress need to place stronger limits on the power of the presidency? If so, be specific on what some of those limits might be. If not, please explain your view. A: Presidents would not have to use executive orders if Congress did their job, and no, Congress does not need to limit presidential powers. Executive orders are a symptom, not the cause, of the extreme polarization of politics and misguided focus in Congress. For example, Congressman Schneider has been in office for six years and raised almost $20,000,000 to get elected. What are his results? Nothing. Zero of his sponsored bills have become law, yet during that time 624 laws sponsored by his peers have become laws. So he is six years, $20,000,000 raised, and 0 of 624. He's not alone, though. You have performers and underperformers just like you would in any industry. But the difference is in Congress the underperformers get away with it if they can be a star fundraiser — like Congressman Schneider and his low performing peers who chair the Democratic fundraising arm with him — another Illinois member of Congress. The media tends to focus on fundraising quarterly rather than publishing who is getting stuff done. And our voters suffer the consequences of that. If we change our attention to results, I think we could change the effectiveness of Congress rather quickly. Q: Protesters have massed in the streets throughout America calling for greater social justice. How significant a role does systemic racism play in limiting equal opportunity in America? To the degree that it exists, what should be done about it? Do you favor reparations? Should police be "defunded"? A: Racism, whether systematic, inadvertent, or latent, does play a part in limiting equal opportunity. Racism is a symptom of our natural tendency to be afraid of who or what we don't know. No amount of training, discussion, reform, regulation, "wokeness," or reparations will solve this issue unless there is an intrinsic desire to change. The best antidote to racism is (early) exposure and economic opportunity for all — and the path with the highest probability of success, I believe, is education. I know this firsthand, as this is my own life story. More than any affirmative action, handouts, reparations, etc. mentorship by role models — family, friends, organizations, or society — can permanently root out racism within a generation. No, police should not be defunded, but policing needs to be re-imagined. The Public Safety approach of Glencoe, where officers are cross-trained in police, fire, and EMT functions, is one worth emulating. While an officer may show up to arrest you if you cause trouble, the same officer may show up to help you if you are in trouble, which automatically engenders a level of compassion and trust, while saving costs and improving utilization and quality. Q: Does today's climate of polarization reflect a natural and necessary ebb and flow in the tone of civic debate? Or does it reflect a dangerous divide? What, if anything, should be done about it? A: No. The tone of civic debate is unusual and reflects an unnecessary and dangerous divide, which at least I have not seen before. I began my career in politics as an undergrad at UC Berkeley in the '90s in a time where we welcomed differences. I was an outsider in my political science classes — a woman, minority, first-generation, low-income college student — who embraced Republican principles. I didn't fit the stereotype of a typical Republican. But my classmates and my professors listened to me and we were all respectful of each other's views — no matter our political party. I was encouraged to speak up and share my difference of opinion, and I was never discriminated against for being a Republican. Yet, how so much has changed since 1995. Fast forward to 2019 when I stepped back in to politics after building a career in finance and tech and obtaining two Ivy League degrees, and I am discriminated now on my party often. Just last week I was refused a technology product because of my political party. This is not how we used to be, and I know we can change this. I hope to be a part of that change. Q: Is there a "cancel culture" in America? A: Yes, unfortunately. As a society, we tend to favor extremes and frequently swing from one extreme to another. This cancel culture has been inflamed by the 24-hour news and unchecked and anonymous social media cycles, where people are convicted in the courts of public opinion before the courts of law. Of course, egregious behavior should be punished, but we should also hear both sides of a story and provide an opportunity for nonhabitual offenders to reform and redeem themselves. Once we jump the gun, no amount of backtracking or corrections can restore reputational damage. Q: What do you see as the most important issues to address regarding immigration reform? If you oppose funding for a wall, what steps do you support to try to control illegal immigration? A: Fortify our borders, enforce existing laws, tweak and expand legal immigration and help our neighbors. Most importantly, we need a consistent immigration policy and message that transcends administrations. Like every other country, we have the right to and must protect our borders.

Troy Antonio Hernandez: Candidate profile, Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago

Three Democrats and three Green Party candidates are running for three, 6-year seats on the board of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, a government agency responsible for spending more than $1.1 billion annually to perform essential functions in preventing flooding and keeping Cook County's waterways clean. Democrat incumbents Cameron "Cam" Davis of Evanston and Kimberly Neely DuBuclet of Chicago are joined on the ballot by Democrat Eira L. Corral Sepúlveda, the Village Clerk of Hanover Park, and Green Party candidates Troy Hernandez of Chicago, a data scientist and solution engineer; Tammie Vinson of Chicago, a Chicago Public Schools teacher; and Rachel Wales of Oak Lawn, a humane farming adviser and freelance writer. You can learn more about the candidates at camdavis.org, kim4water.com, eira4water.com, troyhernandez.com and mwrd-ilgp.org. Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election for the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you?
 If so, what? What specific professional qualifications do you possess that would make you excel in this office? A. I have a Ph.D. in statistics and have been employed in Chicago's tech sector as an expert in data science, AI, and optimization for the last six years. Additionally, I've volunteered for the Pilsen Environmental Rights and Reform Organization for the last six years and with the Chicago R User Group for the last four years. I believe the most pressing issue facing the MWRD is legalized corruption via campaign contributions. Our uniformly Democratic Board of Commissioners have their campaigns financed by large engineering firms. When you have big engineering firms making big campaign contributions to MWRD candidates, you get big expensive engineering solutions at MWRD. If there were green infrastructure companies handing out campaign contributions, MWRD Commissioners might entertain more economical and efficient solutions like green roofs and permeable pavers. I don't take corporate campaign contributions. My goal is to serve the people of the district, not to leech taxpayers for my campaign contributors like typical Madigan Democrats. For a detailed list of my opponents' questionable campaign contributions, go here: southsideweekly.com/running-clean-water-mwrd-finances-2020/ Q. If you are an incumbent, describe your main contributions. Tell us of any important initiatives you've led. If you are a challenger, what would you bring to the board and what would your priority be? A. One of the questions a citizen frequently asks in voting for their MWRD Board of Commissioners is "Do I need a statistician as part of my Board of Commissioners?" The answer is "Yes!" since a statistician can help to optimize design, analysis and interpretation of results, and drawing conclusions. There is no commissioner on the board with my skills, experience, and knowledge. The board recently authorized a $300k contract to a politically connected vendor to update their website. That's outrageous. For that price, we could've hired a full-time employee for three years! My three priorities are to: 1. Align the incentives of the board with the priorities of the district's taxpayers. We need to reform campaign finance laws for the MWRD. I echo my proposal from six years ago to publicly finance our political campaigns. (Available at troyhernandez.com.) 2. Modernize the MWRD's technology to make the district operate more efficiently. This includes using low-cost sensors, aka an internet-of-things (IoT). 3. Prioritize our investments by performing statistical analyses on IoT data to optimize our investments in gray or green infrastructure. Q. Due to the old infrastructure of a combined sewage system, raw sewage may be released into rivers and the lake during a heavy rain. While efforts such as rain barrels are important, does the district have any long-term plans to address the underlying infrastructure issue? A. There are two underlying infrastructure issues. The first being combined sewers. The second being a lack of green infrastructure. As alluded to in a following question, the MWRD is a billion dollar a year agency with a fraction of the attention that the similarly sized Chicago Police Department is currently receiving. If the MWRD has long-term plans to help separate the sewer systems at large, it's not been widely reported. My thoughts on the matter are these: While approximately half of the municipalities within the district have separated sewer systems, given the scope of legacy investments in combined sewer systems in our other municipalities, it's highly unlikely that it's cost-efficient to replace every combined sewer system. However, it would be reasonable to explore targeted investments where separating the sewers makes sense. Regarding green infrastructure, rain barrels aren't going to be enough. We need to ramp up our investments in green infrastructure. As I write below, Milwaukee is committed to 74 times the amount of green infrastructure compared to Chicago: i.e. the largest combined sewer system in the district. Why does Chicago have to be last so frequently? Q. For years, not one suburban Republican has been elected to the board. Should the board be elected by regional districts? A. Given that Republicans get approximately one-third of the votes in Cook County in single-member district elections like the Senate race, it would seem reasonable to expect that they would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. Similarly, the Green Party wins approximately one-third of the vote in MWRD elections, so it would seem reasonable to expect that we would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. This has not happened. To quote a New York Times article on the subject: "The solution is to elect members through ranked-choice voting (RCV), a process in which voters rank listed candidates in order of preference ... In multimember districts, each party is allowed to run as many candidates as there are seats ... Voters would then vote for three candidates, in order of preference. One more tweak is necessary: Because a successful multimember district is one that fairly represents the different viewpoints in that district, you need to mathematically mandate vote thresholds that will guarantee winners. In a three-member district, each candidate would need to win more than 25 percent to be elected." Q. How do you rate the MWRD on transparency and the public's access to records? If you consider it adequate, please explain why. If you think improvements are needed, please describe them and why they are important. A. With an annual budget of over $1 billion, it's imperative that the public's interests are properly represented. While I'm sure my Democratic opponents will pat themselves on the back for their new inspector general (IG), let's remember that: 1. It was originally a Green Party proposal. 2. Some Democratic MWRD Commissioners tried to stall the appointment process. 3. The IG has already found that four commissioners have used their political email accounts, "to solicit MWRD employees ... for political purposes" in this election cycle. Our tax dollars are literally financing my opponents' campaigns against me. Moreover, in an underappreciated agency like the MWRD, increased transparency would not necessarily improve things. The public's appetite for MWRD information is limited. This is why it's the perfect patronage vehicle. For the average MWRD constituent, the less they have to think about us, the better. The priority should be to elect competent commissioners who will serve the public's interest. That's why I push hard on public campaign financing and RCV. If we can create the proper electoral systems and incentives for our elected officials, these issues take care of themselves. Q. What other issues, if any, are important to you as a candidate for this office? A. With a 1,200 character limit, this needs to be emphasized. Chicagoland has experienced its wettest May ever for the third year in the row! An MWRD engineer was quoted last year (on slate.com) saying, "It's now clear that this 50-year, multibillion-dollar project (Deep Tunnel) will not be sufficient to stop flooding in Chicago." And yet, the Democratic MWRD board continues to prefer big engineering solutions. They go on: "The Deep Tunnel is helpless to empty undersized sewers battling against supersize storms and sprawl ... Even the system's original engineers knew that its potential to solve neighborhood flooding would be limited by local infrastructure." Lastly, "the MWRD has committed to creating just 10 million gallons of green infrastructure capacity under its EPA consent decree. Compare that to ... Milwaukee, [which] now believes its green infrastructure will, by 2035 ... hold up to 740 million gallons of rain where it falls." Our priority should be to reduce flooding in our communities' homes, not to enrich our campaign contributors.

Science-based solutions to a science-based crisis Societies thrive with intellectual superiority, technology and ingenuity. Societies weaken when they reject science, facts and logic. Today we face problems that are science based and need leadership that can assess and solve technical problems. 
COVID-19 is a science-based problem. It can be mitigated with testing, vaccine development and public acceptance and awareness. Meanwhile, our current president: delayed the pandemic response and called it a hoax for months; consistently mocks the wearing of masks even though they have been proven to reduce the spread; suggested inane solutions such as ingesting bleach; promoted ineffective solutions such as hydroxychloroquine; and stockpiled 6 million doses of the same ineffective hydroxychloroquine. On June 23 Trump confirmed that he instructed his team to slow down the testing so that it would appear that fewer people had the disease. Trump's anti-science response to the pandemic has caused the U.S. to have 25% of the cases even though we represent only 4% of the global population. None of this is reasonable, acceptable or safe. Clearly we need to remove Trump from the world's most empowered position. We also need to ensure that others in government can apply data and science-based solutions. Fortunately, in our area we are represented by science-based congressional representatives like Sean Casten (biochemical engineer), Raja Krishnamoorthi (mechanical engineer), and Lauren Underwood (nurse.) The expertise of individuals with science backgrounds can help our government drive the solutions we need. Rocco Thomas Venuto Barrington NIMBYs behind moving iron works to South Side On June 25 the Chicago Tribune reported that Gov. Pritzker's IEPA granted the troubled but clout-heavy General Ironworks permission to move its operations from tony Lincoln Park to a blue collar Latino neighborhood on the Southeast Side of Chicago. This is an obvious and despicable case of environmental injustice and racism. Lincoln Park folks have the leisure and money to loudly scream, "Not in my neighborhood." The denizens of the Southeast Side are too busy scraping together a living in this pandemic to fund and organize opposition to a business that fouls the air, increases local hospitalizations and will additionally pollute the Calumet River. Mayor, please show the mettle and decency to prevent General Iron from moving to this location. Jim Arneberg Hoffman Estates

AI trader? Tech vet launches hedge fund run by artificial intelligence

Babak Hodjat believes humans are too emotional for the stock market. So he's started one of the first hedge funds run completely by artificial intelligence.
"Humans have bias and sensitivities, conscious and unconscious," says Hodjat, a computer scientist who helped lay the groundwork for Apple's Siri. "It's well documented we humans make mistakes. For me, it's scarier to be relying on those human-based intuitions and justifications than relying on purely what the data and statistics are telling you."
Hodjat, with 21 patents to his name, is co-founder and top scientist of Sentient Technologies Inc., a startup that has spent nearly a decade-largely in secret-training an AI system that can scour billions of pieces of data, spot trends, adapt as it learns and make money trading stocks.
The team of technology-industry vets is betting that software responsible for teaching computers to drive cars, beat the world's best poker players and translate languages will give their hedge fund an edge on Wall Street pros.
The walls of Sentient's San Francisco office are dotted with posters for robots-come-alive movies such as "Terminator." Inside a small windowless trading room, the only light emanates from computer screens and a virtual fire on a big-screen TV. Two guys are quietly monitoring the machine's trades-just in case the system needs to be shut down.
"If all hell breaks loose," Hodjat says, "there is a red button."
Sentient won't disclose its performance or many details about the technology, and the jury is out on the wisdom of handing off trading to a machine. While traditional hedge funds including Bridgewater Associates, Point72 and Renaissance Technologies have poured money into advanced technology, many use artificial intelligence to generate ideas-not to control their entire trading operations.
All the same, Sentient, which currently trades only its own money, is being closely watched by the finance and AI communities. The venture capital firm owned by Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, and India's biggest conglomerate, Tata Group, are among backers who have given the company $143 million. (Beyond trading, Sentient's AI system is being applied to a separate e-commerce product.)
Trading is "one of the top 10 places that AI can make a difference," says Nello Cristianini, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Bristol who has been advising Sentient. "A trading algorithm can look at the data, make a decision, act and repeat-you can have full autonomy."
Sentient's team includes veterans of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other technology companies. They're part of a small group in Silicon Valley using expertise in data science and the field of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to try and disrupt financial markets.
AI scientists typically have no interest in working for a hedge fund, says Richard Craib, who started the AI hedge fund Numerai. "But they may want to mess around with data sets." Numerai's system makes trades by aggregating trading algorithms submitted by anonymous contributors who participate in a weekly tournament where prizes are awarded in Bitcoin.
It recently raised $6 million from investors including Howard Morgan, the co-founder of the quant investment management firm Renaissance Technologies. "It's entirely a data science problem," Craib says.
Another company, called Emma, started a hedge fund last year based on an artificial intelligence system that can write news articles.
Hodjat of Sentient spent much of his career focused on the language-detection technology behind smartphone digital assistants. Several employees from his previous company, Dejima, went on to create Apple's Siri. Rather than join, he chose to focus on advances in artificial intelligence. His career goals didn't include finance, but he sees markets as one of the most promising applications for the technology. The vast amounts of publicly available data, along with stronger computers to analyze it for patterns, make the field an ideal fit. "That is the fuel for AI," he says.
Sentient's system is inspired by evolution. According to patents, Sentient has thousands of machines running simultaneously around the world, algorithmically creating what are essentially trillions of virtual traders that it calls "genes."
These genes are tested by giving them hypothetical sums of money to trade in simulated situations created from historical data. The genes that are unsuccessful die off, while those that make money are spliced together with others to create the next generation. Thanks to increases in computing power, Sentient can squeeze 1,800 simulated trading days into a few minutes.
An acceptable trading gene takes a few days and then is used in live trading. Employees set goals such as returns to achieve, risk level and time horizon, and then let the machines go to work. The AI system evolves autonomously as it gains more experiences.
Sentient typically owns a wide-ranging batch of U.S. stocks, trading hundreds of times per day and holding positions for days or weeks. "We didn't impose that on the system," says Jeff Holman, the company's chief investment officer. "The artificial intelligence seems to agree with what you get from human intelligence that it's better to spread your bets and have a more diversified portfolio."
As impressive as Sentient's technology appears, it's hard to know if it works. The company says the AI system is beating internal benchmarks, but won't disclose what those are. It shares little about the data used for the AI's decision-making and isn't profitable. The company plans to bring in outside investors later this year. Holman, a Wall Street veteran who joined last year, said the company is limited on what it can say by U.S. Securities Exchange Commission rules restricting marketing by hedge funds that are raising money. "The platform is solid," he says. "It doesn't look like any other strategy I've seen."
Anthony Ledford, the chief scientist at the $19 billion hedge fund Man AHL in London, warns of putting too much faith in this branch of artificial intelligence without more evidence. Man AHL uses machine learning for a portion of its clients money, and Ledford is encouraged by the results. While the company is exploring a stand-alone machine-learning strategy, he says it's too early to declare success. "There's a lot of hype and promise," Ledford says. "But when you actually ask people how many hundreds of millions dollars they are trading, many of them don't come back with much at all."
Little performance data is available about AI-focused hedge funds. One index that tracks 12 pools that utilize AI as part of its core strategies, called Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, returned 5 percent last year. That's slightly better than the average hedge fund, but trailed the S&P 500.
Tristan Fletcher, who wrote his doctoral thesis on machine learning in financial markets and works for a hedge fund, says investors may be reluctant to turn over their money completely to a machine. "I know how conservative investors are and I know of no one who would put their money in a system that's fully systematic," says Fletcher. "Machine learning isn't a panacea for everything. You need people who have literal thinking."
Chen Chen worked for Sentient until 2012 as an analyst. In August 2011, while the company was still known as Genetic Finance and operating in secret, the system was trading when Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating for the first time, sending markets into turmoil. Chen, now a trader in Hong Kong, went back to review the system's performance for the day and saw it had outperformed the market and made money. He notes that there was no precedent for a U.S. downgrade and wonders how Sentient's AI system made its decisions. "That was a big surprise," he says.

For me, it's scarier to be relying on those human-based intuitions and justifications than relying on purely what the data and statistics are telling you." Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris

As the global pandemic reaches new heights across the United States, Americans are likely to be spending even more time at home this winter. With home shoppers already searching for more space in a housing market that has yet to slow down, last week Realtor.com revealed the top suburbs that offer the most affordable space near the nation's 10 largest metros. "These areas just outside of the urban centers of the largest metros offer homebuyers more space for the money. Potential buyers who've been dreaming of more space for work and play don't have to look far to save 29% per square foot on average or get 25%-65% more square footage for the same price as a home closer to downtown," said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. "For a 2,000-square-foot home, this could mean 500-1,300 additional square feet." 
In Illinois, one community made the website's Top Ten. Palos Hills, a Southwest suburb of Chicago, was listed at No. 3 with its median home listing price of $379,000 (single-family homes, 1,800 square feet or larger). That is a cost of $139 per square foot, 24% less per square foot to a comparable home in the city, Realtor.com said. Realtor.com identified the top suburbs that offer the most affordable space by analyzing list prices and median price per square foot for single-family homes within 25 miles of the nation's 10 largest metros. The biggest savings out of the 10 largest metros can be found in Fullerton, California, where homebuyers can find a 2,000-square-foot single family home for $304,000 less, on average, than in nearby Los Angeles. Also offering significant savings is Clark, New Jersey, right outside of New York City, where buyers can save almost a quarter of a million dollars, on average, on a 2,000-square foot home, or get an additional 1,025 square feet for the same budget compared to similar city homes. Palos Hills offers a dense suburban feel with most of its 17,195 residents owning their homes. An array of restaurants, coffee shops and parks — including Bennett Park, where they offer outdoor movies and fishing — make this town a draw for young professionals and retirees, the website says. The area is also home to many young families because of its top-rated school system, which includes Oak Ridge Elementary School — with a GreatSchools rating of 10 out of 10. For those looking for more space, here's where to head (ranked by median listing price): 1) Sicklerville, N.J. Urban Metro: Philadelphia Median Listing Price: $282,000 Savings Per Square Foot: 20% (Suburb: $118 / Urban: $148) Median Income: $89,300 A 30-minute drive southeast of Philadelphia, Sicklerville is a community located within Winslow Township in Camden County, N.J.

Urban Metro: Chicago Median Listing Price: $379,000 Savings Per Square Foot: 24% (Suburb: $139 / Urban: $184) Median Income: $65,700 Palos Hills is a southwest suburb of Chicago, offering a dense suburban feel with most of its 17,195 residents owning their homes.

For complete election coverage, visit dailyherald.com. Q. Describe your vision for the primary role of a community college. Theresa Bashiri-Remetio: With the support and encouragement of the board, a community college's role is to develop creative, cost-effective initiatives to address student learning and workforce preparation. It is crucial that the college continue to explore innovative ways to help the institution adapt to the ever-changing job market, educational/technological advances, budgetary constraints and student needs. Robert Boron: There is not one primary role of a community college, but rather three distinct roles, depending upon the constituency to be served. The first role is to provide an affordable institution in which those graduating high school can begin their postsecondary education, with a goal of continuing on to a traditional four-year college or university. A community college can allow a high school graduate to affordably continue his or her education while providing a head start toward a college degree. Often, these students desire some extra time to decide upon a career path, and can get a taste of potential careers without the financial commitment a four-year college requires. A second constituency would use Oakton to obtain the skills and training needed to engage in a career which does not require a college degree. To these people, a community college provides the most economical path to their desired careers. To a third constituency, Oakton represents the most convenient and accessible source of continuing one's education for personal advancement and intellectual enhancement. In all cases, a community college is affordable and accessible, while offering curriculum which addresses the wide-ranging needs and desires of residents of the Oakton Community College district. Gail Bush: The community college is a uniquely transformative postsecondary educational institution where each student comes with a unique entry point and an expectation of becoming more than they are at the time of their enrollment. For some, it is an exploration; for others, it is a way station on a determined path; for all, it is a learning environment designed to be of service to students' aspirations as they rise through life. While it is the fundamental responsibility of the college to impact student lives through education, it is also inspiring and empowering to experience this journey along side each other. It is the human story told every day at Oakton Community College. Allan Cohen: Oakton is an important, open access component of public education in our community. It contributes to developing productive, knowledgeable and successful members of a democratic society. It provides wide-ranging education throughout a lifetime including: associate degree, vocational, certificate and continuing education. Alexandra Eidenberg: My vision for Oakton is for it to continue being a student-centered college known for its amazing academic programs, fantastic faculty and staff, and for there to be a focus on equity and diversity. Kyle Frank: Community colleges should be in service for associate degrees and vocational certificates. In addition, we need to work on dual credit with feeder high school districts on topics not offered be the Advanced Placement programs. Examples include Calculus 3, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. Plus we should offer certificate programs in high school like the welding program being implemented in Evanston and Niles townships. Some states allow community colleges to offer bachelor's degrees. Richard Geline: First is to provide students with a pathway to postsecondary education, either by providing it at an affordable price, a two-year associate degree or an opportunity to transfer to a full four-year college program. Optimally, community colleges will serve to increase students' college and career readiness, provide support for entering students, improve the education of basic skills, strive to raise the overall graduation rate above the national community college average and increase the graduation rate of underrepresented minorities. Second, the community college provides workforce training by providing programs leading to certification in a variety of occupational areas. It further can assist students with gaining experience by partnering with local employers to provide paid internships and exposure to occupations in their chosen fields. Finally the community college provides community enrichment through singular local programming on a variety of civic, cultural and scientific topics. Alternatively the colleges can provide a more formal lifelong learning experience by developing coursework on multiple topics designed for adults beyond the structured formal postsecondary experience. Michele Hays: A community college stands at the intersection of high school and four-year institutions, providing a transitional higher education experience, reinforcement and support for adults who need high school education, workforce training and development, and continuing education. It should provide the community not only with a path access education, but also provide for a more flexible, resilient and educated population. R. Razz Jenkins: I agree firmly with the American Association of Community Colleges, which states the role as, "building a nation of learners." From dual programs with high school, to "at the job" training programs practiced by Cuyahoga Community College in Ohio, to emeritus programs here at Oakton, the community college provides a positive learning experience for home, work and life. Havee Makedon: Community colleges are centers of opportunity for people from disadvantaged backgrounds in our community. They provide students from low-income backgrounds a chance to receive a quality and inexpensive college education. They provide students that didn't perform well in high school a chance to turn things around. They provide workers with a chance to gain valuable skills that will make them more attractive to employers. Clearly, community colleges are one of our society's most valuable public institutions, and, as a public investment, I believe we get a lot more back from such institutions than we spend. Marie Lynn Toussaint: My vision for the primary role of a community college is to provide affordable and accessible education to a diverse population and to procure services and guidance to its student body and the community it serves. Cynthia Veremis: Preparing and inspiring students for entering, or continuing, in the workforce in fields of their passion either as a step into a four-year college or through a certificate or technical program. Wendy Yanow: I believe the primary role of a community college is to serve its community with high-quality, affordable, public higher education that is inclusive and accessible to all. To serve its community so deeply necessitates a focus on teaching, learning, equity and engagement. The community served by the college includes, among other constituencies, recent high school graduates — some of whom will use the experience as a pathway to a four-year degree alternative high school students — adult literacy and high school students, non-English proficient students and lifelong learners. The constituency also includes students seeking career preparation or career development or those wishing to change careers. And it serves the local industries and employers needing well-prepared graduates. The community college is central to the economic well-being of the community and the people it serves. Q. How well is your community college fulfilling that role? What changes, if any, need to be made? Bashiri-Remetio: Overall, I believe the college is doing well, but with the ever-changing needs of students, the changing job market, the need for students to have cost effective access to education and the challenge of reduced funding for education requires a nimble faculty, staff and administration and a board that supports their vision. Boron: While I do not believe that Oakton is failing to meet the needs of the community, I believe it would benefit by further exposure to the community, making more members of the community aware of the curriculum which is available. I believe that there are additional opportunities to market to the community through online communications. In studies performed during my tenure on the Glenbrook High School board, we learned that not everyone likes to obtain information in the same way. While some constituents prefer traditional mailings, others prefer digital communications. I believe Oakton would benefit from a similar study, to determine if residents of the community wish to receive traditional mailings of course catalogs or more economical digital notifications. My wife and I have taken courses at Oakton, so Oakton has our email addresses. Oakton could use this database to provide notifications of, and links to, upcoming courses, thus providing an immediate and low-cost means of reaching those residents who have previously taken courses at Oakton. I also believe it is necessary for the trustees to become more visible to the community, thereby making them more accessible to their constituents. This can be done with simple changes to Oakton's website. Bush: Following the vision stated above, we would need to ask each student for an individual response. As a learning environment serving our pluralistic district, a few considerations are respectfully recommended: 1. In the Oakton Community College Environmental Scan, the National Center for Education statistics are quoted as predicting a significant increase in adult students in coming years. The intake process as we assess the needs of new incoming adult students must ensure that student support services are designed as comprehensively as possible. That assessment requires active listening, respectful inquiry, and dedicated guidance and advisement. 2. All Oakton community members' sense of safety around issues of identity and equity is a complex issue that requires continual review. 3. Another recommendation is to look east to Evanston and prioritize the work that has begun to increase enrollment from this largely underserved area of our district. The Evanston partnership with the Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research could be approached as a resource. This is a multifaceted challenge but one that is essential to meet with innovative and creative problem-solving strategies. The entire college community suffers when all voices are not heard. Cohen: Oakton Community College is a well-run, excellent community resource. With an evolving external world and limited resources, there will always be areas that are worthy of focusing on strengthening. While I am still learning about opportunities for OCC, areas that are worthy of exploring strengthening include: expanding programs serving growing areas of the economy such as health sciences, data analysis and hybrid science programs that include soft and hard sciences; services for student success such as student advising and counseling; support for the Oakton Educational Foundation; encourage shared governance and engagement of faculty and staff; explore opportunities for community engagement. Eidenberg: Oakton is a wonderful school and I look forward to collaborating with the community, faculty, staff and students to continue its excellence. I am particularly interested in transportation and making it better for folks on the east end of the district. Frank: We are on the right track. We are moving in the right direction. We are offering more dual credit and working with high school districts to align our curricula to improve our completion rates. Geline: Oakton Community College presently enjoys an excellent reputation and is admirably fulfilling its role in the community. It can enhance its position by expanding the list of partnerships with four-year institutions in order to provide more pathways for its students Hays: Our family livelihood is built on a foundation that started with a single class at Oakton: my husband took the EMS class, got a job as an EMT-B and continued his education at Oakton to get his paramedic license. He is now a sworn firefighter in Evanston and proud member of Local 742. I want everyone to have access to the opportunities like this that Oakton has to offer — there are too many people in District 535 who are struggling with underemployment while our businesses search for skilled workers — and this while Oakton's enrollment is dropping. Jenkins: Overall, I think that Oakton is doing an excellent job in fulfilling its mission, vision and values. Rather than suggest changes, my expectations are to first learn its process and procedures before advocating for change. After I am up to speed, process improvement suggestions may then be forthcoming. Makedon: Historically, Oakton has done a phenomenal job providing opportunities for members of our community. I was myself a student at Oakton Community College, and the opportunities it provided to me allowed me to complete my undergraduate education and, by extension, my graduate education completely debt-free. My story is not unique, and there are countless individuals that have gone on to have tremendous success because of the opportunities afforded to them by community colleges. In recent years, however, opportunities are being dried up as the board of trustees has adopted more austerity with regard to budgetary policy. The board has also been dominated by toxic political differences that are threatening the body's ability to manage the college's affairs, and solving this division is perhaps the most pressing issue facing the board today. Toussaint: At this time, Oakton is fulfilling that role to the best of its ability. However, if elected, I will work to raise awareness about the resources, classes and certification programs and technological opportunities available. Additionally, I will also advocate for workforce development between Oakton, the high schools in the district and the business district to create more employment opportunities. Veremis: Oakton is doing a good job and is improving. However, expanding partnerships with the business community would better prepare more students for fulfilling the needs of the workforce of the future, enhancing their opportunities for meeting their personal and professional goals. My 49 years in the business community and 35 years in human resources in a multicultural, diverse environment has given me the opportunity to change people's lives. I am committed to continue fulfilling this passion, and do more of it, as a trustee with a great institution such as Oakton Community College. Yanow: Oakton is doing an excellent job fulling its role in the community. In addition to offering more than 2,500 learning opportunities each semester, Oakton's current strategic plan, Success Matters, focuses on essential criteria of access, equity and diversity. Serving a community as large, complex and diverse as Community College District 535 requires emphasis on these considerations. In addition to the academic programming at Oakton, there is an emphasis on career preparation and development and lifelong learning with sufficient resources in place to serve those initiatives. a certificate or technical program. Wendy Yanow: I believe the primary role of a community college is to serve its community with high-quality, affordable, public higher education that is inclusive and accessible to all.

Sikich names a top 100 firm
NAPERVILLE — Sikich LLP, a professional services firm specializing in accounting, technology and advisory services, has been named a top 100 firm by Accounting Today. Sikich remained steady with a ranking of No. 31 on the 2016 list. Additionally, the firm has been named fourth largest in the Great Lakes region. Top 100 firms are ranked by U.S. revenues and are compiled by analyzing responses to "survey, analysis and growth strategies of firms." Accounting firms across North America complete an in-depth financial and operational survey, where trends are uncovered, growth and profitability metrics are highlighted, personnel levels are evaluated and much more. "Being recognized for this award is especially rewarding, as this prestigious national ranking represents the up and coming firms to watch," CEO Jim Sikich said. "Our dedicated professionals have once again demonstrated outstanding client service, resulting in the increase in top-line revenues and bottom line growth."
SCA partners in Maryland
DEERFIELD — Surgical Care Affiliates will partner with Surgery Center of Chevy Chase, bringing SCA's Maryland locations to six and aligning SCA with 24 more high-quality physicians. Surgery Center of Chevy Chase is a patient focused and physician-led outpatient surgery center. "This investment is part of a continued effort to identify and develop relationships with top tier physicians across Maryland and provide patients with high-quality surgical care at a significantly lower cost." said Tim Buono, group vice president of development for SCA.
COD offers data program
GLEN ELLYN — The new Foundations of Data Science certificate program at College of DuPage prepares students for careers in data analysis fields while providing cross-training for employees who want a sought-after skills set. Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining. Christine Monnier, professor of sociology at College of DuPage, said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. She said that most existing certificates in this field are specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on technical aspects. Visit cod.edu/programs/sociology, email monnier@cod.edu or call (630) 942-2438.

Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election for the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you? If so, what? What specific professional qualifications do you possess that would make you excel in this office? A. I have a Ph.D. in statistics and have been employed in Chicago's tech sector as an expert in data science, AI, and optimization for the last six years. 
Additionally, I've volunteered for the Pilsen Environmental Rights and Reform Organization for the last six years and with the Chicago R User Group for the last four years. I believe the most pressing issue facing the MWRD is legalized corruption via campaign contributions. Our uniformly Democratic Board of Commissioners have their campaigns financed by large engineering firms. When you have big engineering firms making big campaign contributions to MWRD candidates, you get big expensive engineering solutions at MWRD. If there were green infrastructure companies handing out campaign contributions, MWRD Commissioners might entertain more economical and efficient solutions like green roofs and permeable pavers. I don't take corporate campaign contributions. My goal is to serve the people of the district, not to leech taxpayers for my campaign contributors like typical Madigan Democrats. For a detailed list of my opponents' questionable campaign contributions, go here: southsideweekly.com/running-clean-water-mwrd-finances-2020/. Q. If you are an incumbent, describe your main contributions. Tell us of any important initiatives you've led. If you are a challenger, what would you bring to the board and what would your priority be? A. One of the questions a citizen frequently asks in voting for their MWRD Board of Commissioners is "Do I need a statistician as part of my Board of Commissioners?" The answer is "Yes!" since a statistician can help to optimize design, analysis and interpretation of results, and drawing conclusions. There is no commissioner on the board with my skills, experience, and knowledge. The board recently authorized a $300k contract to a politically connected vendor to update their website. That's outrageous. For that price, we could've hired a full-time employee for three years! My three priorities are to: 1. Align the incentives of the board with the priorities of the district's taxpayers. We need to reform campaign finance laws for the MWRD. I echo my proposal from six years ago to publicly finance our political campaigns. (Available at troyhernandez.com.) 2. Modernize the MWRD's technology to make the district operate more efficiently. This includes using low-cost sensors, aka an internet-of-things (IoT). 3. Prioritize our investments by performing statistical analyses on IoT data to optimize our investments in gray or green infrastructure. Q. Due to the old infrastructure of a combined sewage system, raw sewage may be released into rivers and the lake during a heavy rain. While efforts such as rain barrels are important, does the district have any long-term plans to address the underlying infrastructure issue? A. There are two underlying infrastructure issues. The first being combined sewers. The second being a lack of green infrastructure. As alluded to in a following question, the MWRD is a billion dollar a year agency with a fraction of the attention that the similarly sized Chicago Police Department is currently receiving. If the MWRD has long-term plans to help separate the sewer systems at large, it's not been widely reported. My thoughts on the matter are these: While approximately half of the municipalities within the district have separated sewer systems, given the scope of legacy investments in combined sewer systems in our other municipalities, it's highly unlikely that it's cost-efficient to replace every combined sewer system. However, it would be reasonable to explore targeted investments where separating the sewers makes sense. Regarding green infrastructure, rain barrels aren't going to be enough. We need to ramp up our investments in green infrastructure. As I write below, Milwaukee is committed to 74 times the amount of green infrastructure compared to Chicago: i.e. the largest combined sewer system in the district. Why does Chicago have to be last so frequently? Q. For years, not one suburban Republican has been elected to the board. Should the board be elected by regional districts? A. Given that Republicans get approximately one-third of the votes in Cook County in single-member district elections like the Senate race, it would seem reasonable to expect that they would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. Similarly, the Green Party wins approximately one-third of the vote in MWRD elections, so it would seem reasonable to expect that we would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. This has not happened. To quote a New York Times article on the subject: "The solution is to elect members through ranked-choice voting (RCV), a process in which voters rank listed candidates in order of preference ... In multimember districts, each party is allowed to run as many candidates as there are seats ... Voters would then vote for three candidates, in order of preference. One more tweak is necessary: Because a successful multimember district is one that fairly represents the different viewpoints in that district, you need to mathematically mandate vote thresholds that will guarantee winners. In a three-member district, each candidate would need to win more than 25 percent to be elected." Q. How do you rate the MWRD on transparency and the public's access to records? If you consider it adequate, please explain why. If you think improvements are needed, please describe them and why they are important. A. With an annual budget of over $1 billion, it's imperative that the public's interests are properly represented. While I'm sure my Democratic opponents will pat themselves on the back for their new inspector general (IG), let's remember that: 1. It was originally a Green Party proposal. 2. Some Democratic MWRD Commissioners tried to stall the appointment process. 3. The IG has already found that four commissioners have used their political email accounts, "to solicit MWRD employees ... for political purposes" in this election cycle. Our tax dollars are literally financing my opponents' campaigns against me. Moreover, in an underappreciated agency like the MWRD, increased transparency would not necessarily improve things. The public's appetite for MWRD information is limited. This is why it's the perfect patronage vehicle. For the average MWRD constituent, the less they have to think about us, the better. The priority should be to elect competent commissioners who will serve the public's interest. That's why I push hard on public campaign financing and RCV. If we can create the proper electoral systems and incentives for our elected officials, these issues take care of themselves.

In today's technological business world, the convenience and availability of information has created a downside in our business culture of complacency, confusion, and a false sense of security. Whether they realize it or not, business leaders face a crisis that they will need to overcome with the complex challenges of a global culture that relies on information technology.
Does your company take data security seriously? Most businesses are ill-equipped to deal with data security problems — even well-managed companies are at risk.
Data protection impacts all business sectors across the globe. Compliance with the law and protecting individual privacy are more than legal issues. Failure to respect people's privacy or ensure data security can damage a company's brand and negatively influence consumer buying decisions.
The use of cloud services, databases, and electronic messaging are not only commonplace, but also business critical. Storing data and ensuring confidentiality is a major challenge.
You might laugh at the idea of leaving your office unlocked and unguarded or providing a detailed map to your client's credit card details. However, this is what you are doing if you fail to take firm, decisive steps to protect client information and intellectual property.
A new industry called "information harvesting" is threatening companies around the globe. Business leaders should consider the following questions regarding protection of data assets:
* Have you mapped out your digital protocols for cloud computing, information liability/vulnerability, and the associated risks?
* How will you adapt to be in line with today's technology trends, security measures, and counter measures?
* How do you control who can access sensitive information once it is sent out via the Cloud, email, or other device?
* How do you protect your customer or client information before, during, and after transmission?
If you are serious about the matter of digital asset security, consider the following four ways to increase data security:
* Educate staff members on vulnerabilities to your organization. This requires a liability assessment that should account for third parties
* Review your policies regarding the processing of digital assets, especially if your digital assets are being sent outside your organization. What forms of protection are available for different types of information?
* Seek a solution that provides strong encryption prior to sending your digital assets off-site. How well do you know encryption capabilities?
* Automatically enforce policies that maintain consistency in the protection of how your digital assets are handled.
If you haven't already, it's time to take action. Do you maintain control of data as it is created and distributed? Or, are you at risk of falling victim to the new data harvesting industry?

Incumbent Democrat Lauren Underwood of Naperville faces a challenge from Republican State Sen. Jim Oberweis of Sugar Grove in the race for the 14th Congressional District, which includes the outer ring of the Chicago suburbs from Minooka north to the Wisconsin border. The Daily Herald posed a series of questions to the candidates; here are their responses. Q: What next steps should Congress take regarding the COVID-19 pandemic? A: The last six months have been a terribly difficult time for our community. 
As of writing, more than 180,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Essential workers are putting their lives on the line, small businesses are fighting to stay afloat, and our students, teachers, parents, and school staff have been put into an impossible situation. My immediate priority is keeping our community safe and supporting a robust economic recovery. First, we must get control of this deadly virus with an aggressive national strategy that includes robust COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and free treatment for COVID-19 patients as we develop a vaccine. Second, as we work to limit the spread of the virus, we need to extend additional loans to our small businesses, extend hazard pay to essential workers, and provide extended unemployment insurance for those who have lost work. Third, we need to put Americans back to work by investing in America. It's time to take action to upgrade American infrastructure. This is no time to play politics: the federal government, with the full cooperation of the White House and both chambers of Congress, must take immediate bipartisan action to save lives and livelihoods. Q: What has Donald Trump's unconventional leadership taught us about politics in the United States? What is the best thing his presidency has done? What is the most significant criticism you have of it? A: I will always work with this administration to deliver for our community. President Trump has signed three pieces of my legislation into law. The first was the Lower Insulin Costs Now Act, which makes generic insulins available on the marketplace sooner. With bipartisan support, I passed legislation to fund an electronic health record system to prevent children from dying of preventable illnesses while in federal custody on the border. This March, President Trump signed a piece of legislation I wrote to examine our reliance on a foreign-based medical supply chain, which threatens our national security during a pandemic. Sadly, the president has not lived up to his oath of office. He presides over an overtly corrupt administration and has invited foreign nations to interfere in our elections. He began a trade war via tweet that devastated our rural economy. He has incited violence and encouraged divisiveness. His administration has failed to implement a national COVID-19 strategy to provide testing and treatment and support a robust economic recovery. The President's own words regarding his Administration's response to COVID-19 say everything: "I don't take responsibility at all." Q: Many critics of governmental process complain that both Barack Obama and Donald Trump governed too much through executive orders rather than in collaboration with Congress. Is our system in danger of veering toward authoritarianism? From a structural standpoint, does Congress need to place stronger limits on the power of the presidency? If so, be specific on what some of those limits might be. If not, please explain your view. A: One of the problems I identified during my campaign for this office in 2018 was the Congress' staggering lack of oversight over the Trump Administration. My Republican colleagues have been negligent in exercising oversight over the administration's use of taxpayer dollars and fidelity to the law; their refusal to step up and do their oversight duties represents an unacceptable dereliction of duty. I'm shocked that my Republican colleagues didn't immediately begin oversight hearings when we began seeing images of children held in cages on our border. We've seen this extreme partisanship before, and it's bad for our democracy. I've taken the opposite approach. While I disagree with President Trump on nearly everything, I'm still willing to work where we agree. Our democracy is built on a set of checks and balances. When members of Congress refuse to conduct their oversight duties out of loyalty to the president, our democracy is undermined. Authoritarian governments require submission to the executive, and unfortunately, that is what I have seen from many of my Republican colleagues in Congress. Q: Please define your position on health care reform, especially as it relates to the Affordable Care Act. A: I helped implement the Affordable Care Act as a career civil servant at the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services — I know exactly what works and what needs to be improved. In Congress, I've focused on protecting coverage for people with preexisting conditions, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and increasing access to quality, affordable health care — including mental health, maternal health, and reproductive health care. Meanwhile, the Trump Administration is in court trying to dismantle the ACA and the protections the law provides — during a global pandemic. If that lawsuit is successful, 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance. I passed legislation to ensure no taxpayer dollars will support that lawsuit. After hearing from countless families in our community who were forced to ration insulin due to cost, I wrote the Lower Insulin Costs Now Act to help lower-cost, generic insulin become available sooner. I'm proud that President Trump signed that legislation into law at the end of 2019. I look forward to identifying more bipartisan opportunities for progress to expand health care coverage and lower costs during the 117th Congress. Q: Protesters have massed in the streets throughout America calling for greater social justice. How significant a role does systemic racism play in limiting equal opportunity in America? To the degree that it exists, what should be done about it? Do you favor reparations? Should police be "defunded?" A: This summer, our nation has engaged in a conversation about race, racism and white supremacy in America. I was inspired to see peaceful demonstrations throughout the 14th District, calling for change and affirming Black lives matter. I heard my community loud and clear and I helped lead the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to passage through the House. This bipartisan legislation mandates policing reforms to give our communities the tools we need to foster a culture of accountability, transparency and justice in law enforcement. Our nation has grappled with systemic racism for 400 years now. It has expressed itself in numerous ways, including inequalities in our education, health care and criminal justice systems. Police shootings of Black Americans are just one symptom of systemic racism. Here in Illinois, women who look like me are six times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. I founded the bipartisan Black Maternal Health Caucus in Congress to address these disparities and save moms' lives. Together, we introduced landmark legislation and passed a Medicaid expansion in the House to extend access to care for new mothers and save lives. Q: Does today's climate of polarization reflect a natural and necessary ebb and flow in the tone of civic debate? Or does it reflect a dangerous divide? What, if anything, should be done about it? A: What I really love about our community is how we look out for each other. When someone on our street is sick, we organize a meal train. When our neighbor goes out of town for the week, we grab their mail. We may differ in our political views, race or religion, but we have mutual respect for one another. We've said no to the cynical politics that would have us treat our neighbors and community members with fear and suspicion. Clearly, we have some work to do to bring those values to Washington. I think that begins with making our government more responsive to the people. That's why I'm committed to making myself accessible to my constituents across the 14th District. We held 15 town halls in 2019, and another dozen this year. Interacting with our community members one on one, especially when we disagree, helps break through the polarization. I see my job in Congress as bringing the voices and values of northern Illinois to Washington. My office set up nine constituent advisory councils, on issues from education to small business to veterans services, to ensure that I'm doing just that. Q: What role does Congress play with regards to the growth of conspiracy theory groups like QAnon? A: As Vice Chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I know that misinformation on social media is being weaponized against Americans to sow discord, incite violence, cast doubt on the integrity of our elections, and cause confusion about the danger of COVID-19. This proliferation of misinformation is corrosive to our democracy and public trust in government. Congress plays a vital role in ensuring our communities are prepared to defend against this threat. According to a recent report from the Department of Homeland Security, the deadliest terrorism threat we face is brewing at home in the form of white supremacist groups. We need to make sure that suburban and rural communities like ours are prepared to address the threat of domestic terror. I am proud I was able to partner with one of my Republican colleagues in the House to introduce the Safe Communities Act, to help communities like ours defend themselves. Suburban and rural communities have historically been underserved in this area, and I'm focused on making certain our first responders, schools and places of worship have the resources they need to prepare for, respond to and recover from acts of terrorism. Q: What do you see as the most important issues to address regarding immigration reform? If you oppose funding for a wall, what steps do you support to try to control illegal immigration? A: Immigrants are vital to the cultural fabric and economic success of our northern Illinois community and to our country as a whole. We need comprehensive immigration reform that reflects our common values, not a wall or the racist rhetoric and scare tactics commonly employed by the Trump Administration. I co-sponsored the bipartisan American Dream and Promise Act, which passed the House, to provide a path to lawful permanent resident status for immigrants who have lived much of their lives in the United States and have made this country their home. I also voted in favor of the bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act to streamline our temporary worker program and ensure our local businesses have access to the skilled workers they need. I have consistently held the Trump Administration accountable for their inhumane family separation policy, and traveled to the border multiple times to provide oversight of the outrageous humanitarian crisis at our border. I look forward to considering comprehensive immigration reform during the 117th Congress that respects the diversity of our nation and our shared American values. Q: Should everyone wear a mask? Should our schools be open? What has the country done right about the pandemic? What has it done wrong? How optimistic are you that we'll ever get back to "normal"? A: As a registered nurse who worked on the public health response to Ebola and Zika, I know that we can absolutely get back to normal if we all do our part. Each of us needs to wear a mask, practice good hand hygiene, maintain social distancing, and get our flu shots. Over the past six months, the Trump Administration has failed to implement a national COVID-19 strategy to provide the testing, tracing, and treatment needed to limit community spread and support a robust economic recovery. Meanwhile, our families, essential workers, students and small business owners are suffering without the support they need. I've been pleased to vote for several large scale COVID-19 relief packages over the last several months. The House approved our most recent relief package, The Heroes Act, on May 15. I'm deeply disappointed that the Senate has failed to come to the negotiating table to get this sorely needed relief out to our families, small businesses and schools. Now is the time to center the voices of our nation's best scientists and health care experts to save lives and livelihoods — beating COVID-19 should not be a political issue. Q: What do you consider America's role in world affairs? What are we doing correctly to fill that role? What else should we be doing? A: Our country has long been a beacon of democracy and freedom to the world. Those values are critical to our diplomatic strength and leadership in the international community. Today, we find ourselves isolated from our international allies with our democratic values under attack. Due to our lack of a national strategy to manage COVID-19, many American travelers are barred from visiting other countries — something I never could have imagined. We need to elect leaders who will respect our international agreements and value our NATO alliance. Fundamentally, we need leaders who respect our democratic values. I have been profoundly disturbed by President Trump's coziness with autocrats and dictators, and his refusal to stand up for our troops serving abroad. I'm troubled by my Republican colleagues' unwillingness to hold the president accountable. Our country's role as a global leader is predicated on our adherence to democratic values and our alliances with nations and support for people who share democratic values. With President Trump's leadership, we're losing our credibility on the international stage. Q: Do you believe climate change is caused by human activity? What steps should government be taking to address the issue? A: Climate change is caused by human activity and our reliance on fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases, and it's happening before our eyes. Northern Illinois has witnessed extreme weather and unprecedented flooding over the past few years that has caused millions of dollars in damage to businesses, homes, farms, and infrastructure. We have some of the best farmers in the world in Illinois' 14th District, and they cannot afford for us to ignore climate science. That's why I passed legislation to prevent federal agencies like USDA from removing existing public information about climate change from their websites and official communications. As a public health professional, I believe public policy should be driven by science and data. I secured federal resources to fund CDC's Climate and Health Program and strengthen our nation's ability to respond to health threats brought on by climate change. I support the 100% Clean Economy Act, which sets a national goal of achieving a 100% clean energy economy by 2050. Smart investments in clean energy infrastructure will bring high-quality green jobs to our community and will make northern Illinois a leader in this sector. Q: Is there a "cancel culture" in America? A: When we have disagreements on social media, it can be easy to forget there's a person on the other side of the conversation. It's far easier to be disrespectful online than it is to do so in person. We should not, however, be tolerant of intolerance or abusive behavior. On social media, we're often learning out loud, for all of our friends and acquaintances to see. Treating folks we interact with online with the same respect we offer our neighbors would go a long way. As always, I intend to lead by example.

Third, we need to put Americans back to work by investing in America. It's time to take action to upgrade American infrastructure. This is no time to play politics: the federal government, with the full cooperation of the White House and both chambers of Congress, must take immediate bipartisan action to save lives and livelihoods. Q: What has Donald Trump's unconventional leadership taught us about politics in the United States? What is the best thing his presidency has done? What is the most significant criticism you have of it? A: I will always work with this administration to deliver for our community. President Trump has signed three pieces of my legislation into law. The first was the Lower Insulin Costs Now Act, which makes generic insulins available on the marketplace sooner. With bipartisan support, I passed legislation to fund an electronic health record system to prevent children from dying of preventable illnesses while in federal custody on the border. This March, President Trump signed a piece of legislation I wrote to examine our reliance on a foreign-based medical supply chain, which threatens our national security during a pandemic. Sadly, the president has not lived up to his oath of office. He presides over an overtly corrupt administration and has invited foreign nations to interfere in our elections. He began a trade war via tweet that devastated our rural economy. He has incited violence and encouraged divisiveness. His administration has failed to implement a national COVID-19 strategy to provide testing and treatment and support a robust economic recovery. The President's own words regarding his Administration's response to COVID-19 say everything: "I don't take responsibility at all." Q: Many critics of governmental process complain that both Barack Obama and Donald Trump governed too much through executive orders rather than in collaboration with Congress. Is our system in danger of veering toward authoritarianism? From a structural standpoint, does Congress need to place stronger limits on the power of the presidency? If so, be specific on what some of those limits might be. If not, please explain your view. A: One of the problems I identified during my campaign for this office in 2018 was the Congress' staggering lack of oversight over the Trump Administration. My Republican colleagues have been negligent in exercising oversight over the administration's use of taxpayer dollars and fidelity to the law; their refusal to step up and do their oversight duties represents an unacceptable dereliction of duty. I'm shocked that my Republican colleagues didn't immediately begin oversight hearings when we began seeing images of children held in cages on our border. We've seen this extreme partisanship before, and it's bad for our democracy. I've taken the opposite approach. While I disagree with President Trump on nearly everything, I'm still willing to work where we agree. Our democracy is built on a set of checks and balances. When members of Congress refuse to conduct their oversight duties out of loyalty to the president, our democracy is undermined. Authoritarian governments require submission to the executive and, unfortunately, that is what I have seen from many of my Republican colleagues in Congress. Q: Please define your position on health care reform, especially as it relates to the Affordable Care Act. A: I helped implement the Affordable Care Act as a career civil servant at the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services — I know exactly what works and what needs to be improved. In Congress, I've focused on protecting coverage for people with preexisting conditions, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and increasing access to quality, affordable health care — including mental health, maternal health, and reproductive health care. Meanwhile, the Trump Administration is in court trying to dismantle the ACA and the protections the law provides — during a global pandemic. If that lawsuit is successful, 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance. I passed legislation to ensure no taxpayer dollars will support that lawsuit. After hearing from countless families in our community who were forced to ration insulin due to cost, I wrote the Lower Insulin Costs Now Act to help lower-cost, generic insulin become available sooner. I'm proud that President Trump signed that legislation into law at the end of 2019. I look forward to identifying more bipartisan opportunities for progress to expand health care coverage and lower costs during the 117th Congress. Q: Protesters have massed in the streets throughout America calling for greater social justice. How significant a role does systemic racism play in limiting equal opportunity in America? To the degree that it exists, what should be done about it? Do you favor reparations? Should police be "defunded?" A: This summer, our nation has engaged in a conversation about race, racism and white supremacy in America. I was inspired to see peaceful demonstrations throughout the 14th District, calling for change and affirming Black lives matter. I heard my community loud and clear and I helped lead the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to passage through the House. This bipartisan legislation mandates policing reforms to give our communities the tools we need to foster a culture of accountability, transparency and justice in law enforcement. Our nation has grappled with systemic racism for 400 years now. It has expressed itself in numerous ways, including inequalities in our education, health care and criminal justice systems. Police shootings of Black Americans are just one symptom of systemic racism. Here in Illinois, women who look like me are six times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. I founded the bipartisan Black Maternal Health Caucus in Congress to address these disparities and save moms' lives. Together, we introduced landmark legislation and passed a Medicaid expansion in the House to extend access to care for new mothers and save lives. Q: Does today's climate of polarization reflect a natural and necessary ebb and flow in the tone of civic debate? Or does it reflect a dangerous divide? What, if anything, should be done about it? A: What I really love about our community is how we look out for each other. When someone on our street is sick, we organize a meal train. When our neighbor goes out of town for the week, we grab their mail. We may differ in our political views, race or religion, but we have mutual respect for one another. We've said no to the cynical politics that would have us treat our neighbors and community members with fear and suspicion. Clearly, we have some work to do to bring those values to Washington. I think that begins with making our government more responsive to the people. That's why I'm committed to making myself accessible to my constituents across the 14th District. We held 15 town halls in 2019, and another dozen this year. Interacting with our community members one on one, especially when we disagree, helps break through the polarization. I see my job in Congress as bringing the voices and values of northern Illinois to Washington. My office set up nine constituent advisory councils, on issues from education to small business to veterans services, to ensure that I'm doing just that. Q: What role does Congress play with regards to the growth of conspiracy theory groups like QAnon? A: As Vice Chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I know that misinformation on social media is being weaponized against Americans to sow discord, incite violence, cast doubt on the integrity of our elections, and cause confusion about the danger of COVID-19. This proliferation of misinformation is corrosive to our democracy and public trust in government. Congress plays a vital role in ensuring our communities are prepared to defend against this threat. According to a recent report from the Department of Homeland Security, the deadliest terrorism threat we face is brewing at home in the form of white supremacist groups. We need to make sure that suburban and rural communities like ours are prepared to address the threat of domestic terror. I am proud I was able to partner with one of my Republican colleagues in the House to introduce the Safe Communities Act, to help communities like ours defend themselves. Suburban and rural communities have historically been underserved in this area, and I'm focused on making certain our first responders, schools and places of worship have the resources they need to prepare for, respond to and recover from acts of terrorism. Q: What do you see as the most important issues to address regarding immigration reform? If you oppose funding for a wall, what steps do you support to try to control illegal immigration? A: Immigrants are vital to the cultural fabric and economic success of our northern Illinois community and to our country as a whole. We need comprehensive immigration reform that reflects our common values, not a wall or the racist rhetoric and scare tactics commonly employed by the Trump Administration. I co-sponsored the bipartisan American Dream and Promise Act, which passed the House, to provide a path to lawful permanent resident status for immigrants who have lived much of their lives in the United States and have made this country their home. I also voted in favor of the bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act to streamline our temporary worker program and ensure our local businesses have access to the skilled workers they need. I have consistently held the Trump Administration accountable for their inhumane family separation policy, and traveled to the border multiple times to provide oversight of the outrageous humanitarian crisis at our border. I look forward to considering comprehensive immigration reform during the 117th Congress that respects the diversity of our nation and our shared American values. Q: Should everyone wear a mask? Should our schools be open? What has the country done right about the pandemic? What has it done wrong? How optimistic are you that we'll ever get back to "normal"? A: As a registered nurse who worked on the public health response to Ebola and Zika, I know that we can absolutely get back to normal if we all do our part. Each of us needs to wear a mask, practice good hand hygiene, maintain social distancing, and get our flu shots. Over the past six months, the Trump Administration has failed to implement a national COVID-19 strategy to provide the testing, tracing, and treatment needed to limit community spread and support a robust economic recovery. Meanwhile, our families, essential workers, students and small business owners are suffering without the support they need. I've been pleased to vote for several large scale COVID-19 relief packages over the last several months. The House approved our most recent relief package, The Heroes Act, on May 15. I'm deeply disappointed that the Senate has failed to come to the negotiating table to get this sorely needed relief out to our families, small businesses and schools. Now is the time to center the voices of our nation's best scientists and health care experts to save lives and livelihoods — beating COVID-19 should not be a political issue. Q: What do you consider America's role in world affairs? What are we doing correctly to fill that role? What else should we be doing? A: Our country has long been a beacon of democracy and freedom to the world. Those values are critical to our diplomatic strength and leadership in the international community. Today, we find ourselves isolated from our international allies with our democratic values under attack. Due to our lack of a national strategy to manage COVID-19, many American travelers are barred from visiting other countries — something I never could have imagined. We need to elect leaders who will respect our international agreements and value our NATO alliance. Fundamentally, we need leaders who respect our democratic values. I have been profoundly disturbed by President Trump's coziness with autocrats and dictators, and his refusal to stand up for our troops serving abroad. I'm troubled by my Republican colleagues' unwillingness to hold the president accountable. Our country's role as a global leader is predicated on our adherence to democratic values and our alliances with nations and support for people who share democratic values. With President Trump's leadership, we're losing our credibility on the international stage. Q: Do you believe climate change is caused by human activity? What steps should government be taking to address the issue? A: Climate change is caused by human activity and our reliance on fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases, and it's happening before our eyes. Northern Illinois has witnessed extreme weather and unprecedented flooding over the past few years that has caused millions of dollars in damage to businesses, homes, farms, and infrastructure. We have some of the best farmers in the world in Illinois' 14th District, and they cannot afford for us to ignore climate science. That's why I passed legislation to prevent federal agencies like USDA from removing existing public information about climate change from their websites and official communications. As a public health professional, I believe public policy should be driven by science and data. I secured federal resources to fund CDC's Climate and Health Program and strengthen our nation's ability to respond to health threats brought on by climate change. I support the 100% Clean Economy Act, which sets a national goal of achieving a 100% clean energy economy by 2050. Smart investments in clean energy infrastructure will bring high-quality green jobs to our community and will make northern Illinois a leader in this sector. Q: Is there a "cancel culture" in America? A: When we have disagreements on social media, it can be easy to forget there's a person on the other side of the conversation. It's far easier to be disrespectful online than it is to do so in person. We should not, however, be tolerant of intolerance or abusive behavior. On social media, we're often learning out loud, for all of our friends and acquaintances to see. Treating folks we interact with online with the same respect we offer our neighbors would go a long way. As always, I intend to lead by example.

Those of us working through the COVID-19 era may be tiring of video conference calls. It's easy to get Zoomed out, dreading the next "virtual" meeting. But a Zoomer about birding? That's different. 
I couldn't wait to log on for the 2020 Illinois Young Birder Virtual Symposium. The recent Saturday morning confab was time well spent, and ended with a flourish as keynote speaker Kenn Kaufman addressed the kids and took their questions. Kaufman tuned in for the entire symposium, listening to the presentations by some of our state's top young birders and sharing his own perspectives in small doses. There is no bigger fan (and coach) of youth birding than Double K, one of the hobby's rock stars. The symposium is an annual gathering for Illinois Young Birders, a birding club for kids, teens and young adults ages 9 to 18. Administered by the Illinois Ornithological Society, ILYB aims to "foster and ignite a passion for birding among young people, provide community, promote conservation, investigate careers in birding, build positive relationships with other birding groups and, most of all, to have fun!" The fun part is easily achieved through monthly field trips to birding hot spots around the state, primarily in the Chicago region. Of course, ILYB members are usually birding somewhere every weekend. These kids eat, sleep and bird, and their field identification skills often surpass those of their elders. The symposium showcased other skills, including sketching, painting and photography. A slideshow of member artwork and photos played to a soundtrack that included "Birding" by the Swet Shop Boys, a tune worthy of your investigation. Earlier this year, one of the symposium participants, 14-year-old Gracie McMahon from Rockford, was named 2020 Young Birder of the Year by the American Birding Association. Her presentation to ILYB summarized her contest entry, including required elements focusing on conservation and community action. In 2019, Gracie launched a public outreach project in which she hand-painted 52 rocks with different species of birds. Each rock was numbered, with a message on the back: "What bird is this?" along with sandbluff.org, the website of the Sand Bluff Bird Observatory, where Gracie volunteers. The rocks were placed throughout the Rockford area for random people to find. The finders could then go online to watch a video about their bird and receive an invitation to visit Sand Bluff. Gracie and other SBBO volunteers created a short video for all 52 birds. "My project wasn't for people who were already interested in birds," Gracie said. "It was for people who knew nothing about them and weren't aware that birds need our help. Hopefully now they are, and they will continue to expand the birding community." Other symposium presenters were Peter Tolzmann, speaking about the human impact on birds; John Fabrycky on birding in Israel; and Oliver Burrus, sharing insights about data science and "machine learning." Part of Oliver's talk covered iNaturalist, a useful app for helping ID virtually any living thing. Kaufman closed the event with an inspiring talk that reached beyond birding to show how everything in nature is connected. The kids were mesmerized, the way Little Leaguers would be if Anthony Rizzo showed up to their baseball practice. Everyone on the Zoom, it seemed, had read Kaufman's "Kingbird Highway" at least once. "Birds unite us," he said, and "Birds will lead you to everything else in nature." Kaufman reflected on growing up in Indiana and how, at age 6, he learned to put a name on the blackbirds grazing in his yard. They were common grackles and European starlings — not the most exciting "spark birds," he admits, but they were enough. The challenge of finding other birds to identify hooked him on birding. Not surprisingly, as a teen, Kaufman's favorite book was "Wild America," the classic bird-finding travelogue by Roger Tory Peterson and James Fisher, published in 1955. A few of the ILYB members had read it as well, which thoroughly impressed me. Kaufman wrapped up his virtual visit with a call to action, encouraging everyone to share their knowledge and passion with others. "We don't have to make people into rabid birders," he said. "If you can get them to care about birds, to have some interest, then they are likely to support bird conservation in the future. We need a lot more people like that." The message resonated, but was hardly necessary. Not with this group. Young birders, the serious ones, are among the hobby's best ambassadors. We need a lot more of them, too. Visit illinoisyoungbirders.org to learn more and perhaps buy a membership ($10) for the future ornithologist in your life. * Jeff Reiter's column appears monthly in Neighbor.

10,000 steps Steps: New research seeks to find out how much exercise is right amount

Much of what we know about exercise remains a guess, based mostly on experiments from lab treadmills or ideas from often unreliable details recorded in people's diaries and logbooks.
Take the number 10,000, which has come to represent the point at which exercise becomes enough to keep us healthy. According to public-education campaigns, social media and your Fitbit, if you walk or run 10,000 steps a day — about five miles, depending on your stride — you're all good. Look at the science behind this idea, however, and you'll find no magic digits.
Weirdly enough, that goal originated with the manpo-kei, a type of pedometer sold in Japan in the 1960s that literally translates to "10,000-steps meter." The mark then took on a life of its own as researchers began to use it as a baseline in their experiments.
At Stanford, an interdisciplinary team is now launching all manner of experiments to figure out how much the quantitative and qualitative goals we've come to accept as truth are grounded in real science.
Its experiments have volunteers donning various consumer-grade fitness bands, heart-rate monitors and pulse trackers, putting on oxygen masks and then playing basketball — so researchers can learn what happens to our bodies and how well the technology is tracking those changes. They are brainstorming other big ideas, too — studying activity patterns in diverse regions of the world by giving these devices to rural Africans, for example, and creating an app to provide early warning of a heart attack and then dial 911.
Stanford cardiologist Alan Yeung has embarked on what may be the most audacious study of exercise in history.
Using an app on those ubiquitous gadgets that many of us carry around 24/7 — our smartphones, fitness watches and other electronic devices — Yeung and his colleagues are mapping the second-by-second minutiae of how we move. Not just the count of our steps, but all sorts of measures, including our velocity and orientation in space.
Just a year in, the results already are provocative.
For starters, America's couch-potato lifestyle may be worse than anyone thought. Not only are many of us not exercising, the early data also show that a huge percentage of us are barely moving. The finding applies even to people in their 20s through 40s, supposedly the prime of life.
This was a surprise," Yeung said. "A lot of people are spending most of their time sitting around — not even standing, not even going up and down."
The study is one of a number of potentially paradigm-shifting initiatives made possible by the gazillion data points amassed by our smart devices. Stanford's app - which participants download voluntarily — is part of the first generation of projects powered by Apple's ResearchKit, a set of free tools introduced by the company in early 2015 to great fanfare and a fair amount of skepticism.
More than 100,000 people signed up in just the first six months, generating so much information that most of the researchers involved have been able to analyze only a tiny fraction of it.
Stanford's project uses a smartphone's accelerometer (a sensor that measures movement and velocity) and gyroscope (which measures angular rotation across three axes) to analyze how we move. The researchers' goal is to figure out how we can change our movements to improve heart health and live longer.
Eventually, they hope to answer such questions as: Does a person need to exercise daily, or is it OK to be a weekend warrior? Are brief, high-intensity workouts just a fad, or do they actually work?
"We know exercise saves lives," explains project co-director Euan Ashley, head of Stanford's biomedical data science initiative. "What we don't know is what is the right dose."

COD students Amr Elseweifi (Lombard), Nicholas Lindquist (Plainfield) and Kevin Nguyen (Carol Stream) joined students from Benet Academy High School, as well as high school and college students from across the U.S., to take part in the Cosmic Ray e-Lab. Click here to see photos of COD students and faculty working with the cosmic ray detector. Hosted by QuarkNet, a nonprofit collaboration between Fermilab National Laboratory and the University of Notre Dame, the Cosmic Ray e-Lab is a national collaborative project which measured high-energy cosmic rays during the recent solar eclipse. 
Funded by the National Science Foundation, QuarkNet is dedicated to developing the technological workforce in the U.S. According to College of DuPage Physics Professor Tom Carter, the students are gaining experience in several areas. "This project provides the students a great opportunity to work with Fermilab scientists and collaborate with other schools on a national scale," Carter said. "They are working with real science data on a question we don't know the answer to yet. They will also get experience. Early in 2017, COD students and Benet Academy students participated in Cosmic Ray Workshops, during which they constructed and calibrated a cosmic ray detector and learned how use it to make measurements and analyze data. During the recent solar eclipse, Benet Academy students measured locally the activity of particles known as muons while COD's detector was used to take measurements in Washington, Mo., in the eclipse's path of totality. Currently, the students are analyzing the data they collected, studying the timing and direction of the muons over a period of approximately two days leading up to and after the eclipse. The students then uploaded the data to a data portal that houses all of the data collected from labs, high schools and colleges nationwide. Benet Academy teacher and part-time COD Physics faculty Jennifer Gimmell said she hopes the students' participation in the project will inspire and motivate them to dig deeper into science in their studies and consider possible careers in the sciences. "I hope that students really do see that Tom Carter and I, as well as other scientists and educators in the sciences, are still excited – like kids on Christmas morning," she said. "We're also sometimes baffled by stuff we don't understand just like they are, and that's part of the fun of the process of discovery."

To ACT or SAT? That is the Question!
Reading Comprehension: What Kind of Decision Maker is your Student?
When reading, some students are more like Rodin's Thinker — deliberate, calculating, cautious in their decision making. Others prefer more of a Looney Tunes roadrunner approach, reading and reacting quickly based on initial impressions, interpretations, and judgments.
The new SAT features passages with greater text complexity, so the reading requires a bit more thoughtful analysis. The SAT also grants 43% more time per question, however, so students have increased time for thorough work of pondering the passages and the questions.
So, if students prefer the extra time and enjoy deep-sea-diving into texts to arrive at decisions and conclusions, then the SAT is for them. However, if students prefer to skim the surface waters and glean the meaning quickly, making decisions on first impressions, then the ACT is the choice.
Mathematical Reasoning: What Kind of Problem Solver is your Student?
While SAT and ACT math largely covers similar material, SAT is a bit more demanding on thorough, algebraic problem solving and less concerned with a student's memory of geometry formulae.
What's more, ACT allows a student use of a calculator throughout its 60 math questions, while SAT does not allow calculator use for 20 of its 58 math questions. Of those 58 questions, 13 are student-produced-response questions, which feature no multiple-choice answers.
In short, on the SAT, students have to do math more the old-fashioned way: they earn it! So, if your student is a problem solver, who is comfortable working it out, grinding it out, calculating answers by hand, then SAT is the preferred option. If your student is more calculator dependent in arriving at his or her answers, ACT may be the preferred path to math.
Science Reasoning? Does your Student Enjoy a Full Science Serving or Merely Appetizer Portions?
While both the SAT and the ACT assess science through data presentations and analytical questions, ACT features a standalone science section always situated at the end of the multiple-choice sections. On ACT, science is always the fourth section, after English, Math, and Reading, while on SAT 35 science-related questions are spread throughout reading, grammar, and math.
So, if your student is fond of science, and enjoys a healthy, full order of science (ending the test with science as the last section), then ACT is the right choice. If your student would prefer some assorted science appetizers, delivered as small servings throughout the exam, then he or she has an appetite for SAT science.
English Grammar and Essay Writing: Apples to Apples
The Hamlet-like dilemma, "To ACT or SAT," is simplified when it comes to the English grammar and essay writing sections, which are largely the same.
The content of the grammar on both exams targets usage & mechanics skills (e.g., sentence construction, punctuation) and rhetorical skills (e.g., essay composition principles and practices), so there is no avoiding a healthy and necessary assessment of your student's college-readiness proofreading and copy-editing skills!
As for essay writing, both essays on the respective exams are optional, unless the colleges to which your student is applying specify otherwise. These essays require argumentative writing, evidence-based reasoning, and a solid grasp of essay structure and logic.
While the ACT will require a synthesis of multiple positions on a topic of controversy, the SAT will require analysis of a text. Either writing task requires a strong and capable grasp of persuasive writing, a valuable skill to acquire before shuffling off to college.
Resolving the drama
If you still are racked with indecision after this explanation, let us help you decide whether the SAT or ACT is better for your student through our complimentary testing and analysis. Try them both, and allow us to help you compare and contrast and find the better fit.

Lauren Brzezinski has a tough decision to make in the coming days. The 28-year-old teacher at Hawthorn Elementary South in Vernon Hills is conflicted about whether to return to her first-grade classroom to teach students face-to-face or instead continue with remote instruction, if she's offered that option. She's one of thousands of teachers across the suburbs weighing their comfort level with returning to in-person instruction, evaluating how the COVID-19 pandemic may change their jobs, and figuring out ways to deal with the stress of risking their health to fulfill their calling. "I feel very torn. 
I miss my students so much. I want to be back in the classroom," Brzezinski said. "I know that students' social-emotional needs right now are really high and I want them to come back to the classroom to have that socialization, to make sure they are OK. But at the same time, I worry about everybody's health. ... It's just a really hard decision." It certainly is, and schools, parents and teachers are caught in the middle of a raging debate. While the Trump administration says it's important for all schools to reopen in person to start the school year, many experts says science should drive the decision. After surveying parents and employees, many suburban school districts are working on reopening plans using state guidelines that allow schools to operate next month in one of three ways — entirely in person, fully remote or through a blended learning model. Several districts are considering a hybrid approach, offering families a choice between virtual learning and in-person instruction with limited capacity and precautions, such as increased sanitizing, mandatory face coverings and social distancing. A few are returning to fully in-person or online instruction. Yet, many details and logistics are still being worked out by districts and local teachers unions, and many unanswered questions remain, including whether teachers, like parents and students, will be able to opt out of in-person learning or receive hazard and sick pay if they get infected with COVID-19. Brzezinski said social distancing might be most challenging for a group of 25 first-graders who "haven't seen their friends in months" and love giving hugs, high-fives and fist bumps. "If we are able to set the standard and the expectation from day one and really just be consistent, I think that we could see some success," she said. The Illinois Education Association urges school districts returning to in-person instruction to spell out their policies regarding face coverings, social distancing and cleaning schedules, as well as ensuring adequate and appropriate cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment for all employees. "We need to make sure that when our fall semester begins that it is done safely and we are following science and data," said Kathi Griffin, president of the state's largest teachers union representing 135,000 members. Griffin said teachers and other school employees, such as paraprofessionals, secretaries, custodians, cafeteria workers and bus drivers, must have input in school reopening plans. "We need to go to the experts to find out what's going to work best," she said. "This is so new. ... We're building the plane while it's flying." Not everyone believes a return to the classroom is advisable. Rae Goodman, 37, of Northbrook, said teachers should have the option of working remotely to protect their health, just like parents are allowed to opt out of in-person instruction for their children's safety. "To be back in the building for the sake of being back in the building, I don't think that's what people want, teachers or anybody else," Goodman said. Goodman teaches math and science one-on-one to high school students two days a week at Fusion Academy in Lake Forest, a private middle and high school providing personalized instruction. She's unsure if the school will require teachers to be on campus this September. Even in well-funded school districts, teachers might be asked to go beyond their regular duties to help sanitize classrooms and student materials between periods. Some teachers might not want to return to work under those conditions, Goodman said. Cathy Malone of Plainfield said the demands on teachers already are great. She's not comfortable with school administrators adding the responsibility of keeping classrooms sanitized to their job requirement. "I know whatever decisions are made there will be risks," said Malone, 54, a 32-year veteran who teaches sixth-grade math and social studies at Scullen Middle School in Naperville-based Indian Prairie Unit District 204. "If we can mitigate the risks as much as possible, I'm willing to do my part." District 204's plan involves a hybrid approach with roughly half the students attending school twice weekly. The district devised the plan after surveying more than 10,000 parents and roughly 3,000 employees. Parents can opt out of in-person learning and choose the virtual option for their children, but it's unclear if teachers have that same choice, Malone said. "Overall, there is not going to be one correct answer for all school districts everywhere," Malone said. "I just hope that everybody recognizes that school districts and teachers are trying to make the best decisions we can for everybody involved." Tina Pizzitola of Streamwood, an Elgin Area School District U-46 paraeducator, is part of an eight-member intervention team whose job is supporting students' behavioral and social-emotional needs. Among her responsibilities is helping maintain a clean environment for students who typically use common manipulative supplies such as play dough, fidget spinners and sensory items. "We're probably going to have to look at a more in-depth sterilization process," Pizzitola said. "(We) have been brainstorming how to develop individualized materials for each student." Pizzitola, 55, has a genetic heart defect and is in a high-risk category for complications from COVID-19. "I still plan on coming back as long as safety protocols are in place," she said of U-46 moving to hybrid learning next month, the details of which will be released today. "We know we have to do this right because if we don't do this right, people are going to die."

Federal aid a small piece of school revenue

Federal funding, which President Donald Trump threatened to take away from schools that don't reopen in the fall, represents an average 7% of revenue for the 852 public school districts in Illinois. Nearly 27% came from state funding and nearly 66% from local funding in fiscal year 2018, the latest data available from the Illinois State Board of Education, said spokeswoman Jackie Matthews. The federal funding comes in the form of different grant programs, such as for low-income students, special education, nutrition, after-school programs and parent activities tied to children's education. There is also funding specifically for rural school districts and for districts with students or parents who are migrant workers. 
As for Trump's comments Wednesday to pull funding if schools don't bring students back, "I think schools are primarily focused on developing their reopening plans and coming up with plans that keep students, teachers and families safe, and maximize their instruction," Matthews said. Chicago Public Schools, the largest school district in the state, got the most federal grant money at $448.1 million in fiscal year 2019-20, and Elgin Area School District U-46, the state's second-largest, received $31.6 million, according to ISBE's information. U-46 Superintendent Tony Sanders said federal funding accounted for about 6% of the district's $594 million budget for the 2019-20 school year. He said the total figure was more than $34 million through May 31, of which $8 million funded Title 1 programs for low-income students, $7.9 million went to the National School Lunch Program, and $6.2 million was allocated for special education. Trump's comments will not affect plans in U-46 because "the president does not have the authority to withhold those funds," Sanders said. "We are opening either way," he said. "It can't stop ... what we are planning for next school year." Sanders said the district still must abide by guidance provided by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as state and local health departments. "If (Trump's) requirement is to have every kid, every day in person, then that would be advice I would have to go against based on the CDC regulations, state health department, local health department, all of whom say that we must really work to provide that 6 feet of space, and also wearing of face masks and all the protections," Sanders said. In the suburbs, others that got large sums include East Aurora School District 131, which got $13 million, Palatine School District 15, which got $5.9 million, and Round Lake School District 116, which got $4.5 million, according to the ISBE. Rondout School District 72, a K-8 school district in Lake County, got the least in the state — $1,187. Libertyville-Vernon Hills Area High School District 128 received nearly $221,000 in federal funds last year, according to ISBE. The full figure is about $600,000 including Medicaid reimbursement, mostly for special education, said Dan Stanley, the district's assistant superintendent of business. "With federal funding representing less than 1% of District 128, I do not foresee the loss of funding affecting our reopening plans. Even if special education funding is cut, it does not remove the requirement for the district to provide those services," Stanley said. Township High School District 214, headquartered in Arlington Heights, will follow the guidance of state and local authorities and will be releasing its reopening plans later this month, district spokesman Dave Beery said. The district got nearly $1.7 million in federal grant funding last year, according to ISBE's data. "While the White House comments add one new dimension, school districts already have been working with a landscape that shifts in one way or another almost daily. This is one more element that we will work with in crafting our reopening guidelines," Beery said. ISBE encourages in-person instruction, because that's the best way that students can learn, but the guidance of science and data regarding the COVID-19 spread is crucial, Matthews said. "We are working very closely with the Illinois Department of Public Health, which has a team of epidemiologists, infection preventionists and medical experts who are providing information on the guidance." * Daily Herald staff writer Madhu Krishnamurthy contributed to this report.

5 myths about the 2016 presidential election

The 2016 election is nearly two years behind us, but debates continue to rage over what lifted President Donald Trump to a victory that surprised so many political observers. All elections generate narratives that try to explain the outcome, but often those do not square with polling and other political science data. This conflict is remarkably sharp in the case of the 2016 election, in part because of the unusual nature of Trump's candidacy. Here are five of the most prevalent myths. Angry voters drove the results. 
Before and after the election, a dominant narrative held that the voters were angry. "Dissatisfaction, anger dominate year-end reviews of Washington," reads a December 2015 CNN headline above an article reporting that 69 percent of voters were "at least somewhat angry" with the way things were going in America. Two years later, U.S. News & World Report observed that "furious Americans elected Donald Trump." But there is no evidence that Americans were any more angry in 2016 than they had been in 2012, when President Barack Obama won re-election. When CNN asked that same question in February 2012, 67 percent of voters said they were angry, only 2 percentage points less than in 2016, well within the margin of error. And other data suggested a rosier outlook: In early 2016, for instance, consumer confidence was rising among all income groups, and it was as high as it was at the same point in 1984, when Ronald Reagan won re-election under the "morning in America" banner. Throughout 2016, Obama's approval rating increased, hitting 56 percent in December. Trump can say or do anything without losing support. Trump created endless controversies during the presidential campaign yet prevailed, inspiring a theory that he was "unattackable," as CNN's Chris Cillizza put it. A Washington Post analysis in December 2015, during primary season, concluded: "It's as if it doesn't matter if (criticism of Trump) ‘sticks' or not. ... His supporters just don't care." As Trump himself famously put it, "I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters." The effects of specific controversies were often short-lived, but polling data show that they did hurt Trump. During the primary campaign, Trump's net favorability among Republicans dropped sharply — from +27 points to +11, according to YouGov/Economist polls — after he criticized John McCain's record as a POW in Vietnam. It fell again after he made offensively critical comments about Megyn Kelly following the Aug. 6, 2015, primary debate (+27 points to +13) and after he skipped a January 2016 debate (+38 points to +22). Clinton's inept campaign cost her the election. During the general-election campaign, Trump's standing in the polls suffered at multiple points, especially after the release of the infamous "Access Hollywood" video. It turns out that boasting about sexual assault on tape can drive at least some voters away. After Election Day, the Clinton campaign faced the predictable recriminations. "A series of strategic mistakes likely sealed Clinton's fate," including too much time spent attacking Trump, according to The Washington Post. Politico argued that she failed to "get the basics of campaigning right." Yet our experiments showed that voters randomly assigned to watch her attack ads on Trump were more likely to support her and less likely to support him. Clinton, we found, did better in media markets where she had a larger advantage in televised advertising, another sign that her ad strategy was sound. It is true that her field organization was smaller than Obama's had been in Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin (though not in Michigan) — all states Trump won — but research suggests that the impact of field organizing is modest: We estimate that having a field organization equal to Obama's wouldn't have swung these essential battleground states. Trump's victory was due to economic anxiety. One particular rationale for Trump's victory came to the fore immediately after the election: He "tapped into the anger of a declining middle class," as Bernie Sanders put it, with a message that appealed to "people (who) are tired of working longer hours for lower wages." The journalist David Cay Johnston concurred: "Trump won because many millions of Americans, having endured decades of working more while getting deeper in debt, said ‘enough.'" But the evidence is clear: Both in the Republican primaries and in the general election, white voters' attitudes about blacks, Muslims and immigration were more closely associated with how they voted than were any strictly economic concerns. In fact, racial attitudes were the prism through which voters thought about economic outcomes — something we call "racialized economics." For example, after Obama became president, attitudes toward blacks suddenly became linked with people's views on the economy: the less favorable their view of blacks, the less favorable their view of the economy. In the general election, the belief that split Trump and Clinton supporters was not whether "average Americans have gotten less than they deserve." Majorities of both groups agreed. Instead, the dividing line was whether they thought "blacks have gotten less than they deserve": Fifty-seven percent of Clinton supporters agreed, but only 12 percent of Trump supporters did. Democratic voters are ideologically divided. The Democratic Party is supposedly riven between Sanders-like progressives and Clintonian centrists. But in the surveys we examined, there were few differences on key policy questions like the role of government in providing health care or child care. No wonder nearly 80 percent of Sanders voters became Clinton supporters in the general election — more than the share of Clinton voters who ended up backing Obama after the 2008 primary contest. That's not to say there are zero divides within the Democratic electorate, but they are often not the usual suspects. During the primaries, the real gaps were linked to party, race and age: Clinton supporters were more likely to be registered Democrats, nonwhite and older. In the general, the fault lines that mattered again involved race and immigration, not economic policy. We find that in 2012, a substantial fraction of Obama voters had conservative views about race and immigration. Roughly a third said it should be harder to immigrate to the U.S. It was these voters who were more likely to shift to Trump in 2016. Still, the party's divides appear to be diminishing. The fraction of Democrats with more-conservative immigration views is rapidly shrinking — probably in reaction to the Trump presidency. In the end, the party remains fundamentally united on many key policy issues. * Sides is a professor of political science at George Washington University.

Dems to probe if officials meddled with virus data

WASHINGTON — A House subcommittee is launching an investigation into whether political appointees have meddled with routine government scientific data to better align with President Donald Trump's public statements about the coronavirus pandemic, following a report that one such appointee claimed scientists were trying to undermine Trump. The Democrat-led subcommittee said Monday that it is requesting transcribed interviews with seven officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services, including communications aide Michael Caputo. Caputo has often publicly pushed back on CDC statements about the coronavirus and said falsely in a Facebook video on Sunday that the CDC has a "resistance unit" against Trump, according to The New York Times. 
His page has since been made private. According to a report in Politico, Caputo, along with scientific adviser Paul Alexander, pressured officials to alter the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, a long-running weekly journal that features the latest science-based research and data on infectious diseases. Known as MMWR, the report has long been a sacred government information resource for doctors, scientists and researchers tracking outbreaks. The officials pressured CDC to change the reports, at times retroactively, to better align them with Trump's often rosier public statements about the coronavirus, Politico reported. According to Politico, Caputo and Alexander also complained about a report that explained children can transmit the coronavirus and Alexander asked the CDC to alter it or pull it down, saying the report could impact school reopening and hurt Trump politically. In the Facebook Live video, Caputo warned that left-wing hit squads would engage in armed insurrection after the election and said officials were engaging in "sedition" as they handled the pandemic. "You understand that they're going to have to kill me, and unfortunately, I think that's where this is going," Caputo said, according to the Times. Caputo is a longtime friend and fierce defender of Trump who worked on his presidential campaign.

Cancer researchers: It's time to pay more attention to ‘miracle' patients

Call it luck — or a medical miracle.
During clinical trials for experimental cancer drugs, some patients simply respond better than others.
And a tiny fraction of patients see dramatic results, responding so well to treatment that they survive forms of cancers that quickly kill their counterparts.
Stories about people like Emily Whitehead, the then-6-year-old who was enrolled in a clinical trial that saved her life, make headlines. But statistically speaking, they're insignificant, mere outliers. Because they deviate so far from the norm, these "exceptional responders" are often overlooked by researchers.
Not so fast, says Eric Perakslis.
Perakslis, who heads up pharmaceutical giant Takeda's oncology data science program and is a visiting faculty member in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, argues that their genes could hold clues that cancer researchers have been missing.
He wonders whether the reasons behind these unusual responses could lead researchers to more effective cancer treatments.
In a recent editorial in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the former FDA chief information officer and kidney cancer survivor joins a growing chorus of voices calling for more research on exceptional responders. If scientists sequence and study the genomes of these patients, Perakslis argues, they could uncover potential cures that may work for traditional patients, too.
"There's a reason they do well, right?" Perakslis says. "We as humans may or may not be smart enough to find it, but there's a reason."
A hunt for that reason could reveal new information about different cancers, he argues — as in one case in which a patient with metastatic bladder cancer saw dramatic results with an experimental drug that was abandoned after an unsuccessful trial. Analysis of the patient's genome eventually identified a previously unknown biomarker found in some other bladder cancers.
Given that over 8 million people die of cancer each year worldwide, Perakslis says it's time to establish a national exceptional responder network among clinical trial participants that offers free genome sequencing, registers all patients who do unexpectedly well during clinical trials, and makes their data available to qualified researchers.
He finds inspiration in the national Undiagnosed Diseases Network, which pools clinical and research resources to solve medical mysteries. If the kind of broad-scale initiative open to patients with the rarest diseases were available to cancer patients, too, he argues, unlocking their secrets could become easier and cheaper — and reveal critical clues faster.
"These outliers are really important humans," Perakslis says. "They can help us fill in the map." He compares exceptional responders to the outside edge of a puzzle — the part most people must complete before the larger structure becomes clear.
Jean Claude Zenklusen, who directs the National Cancer Genome Atlas at the National Institutes of Health, agrees. He participates in the National Cancer Institute's Exceptional Responders Initiative, a project aimed at understanding the molecular underpinnings of those whose cancers respond to all different kinds of treatment.
"Thanks to this program, we now know that breast cancer is not breast cancer. It's really five different diseases," he says. Because of the insights yielded by exceptional responders' genes, Zenklusen says, researchers now realize that some cancers share molecular signatures despite the anatomical location of the tumors themselves.
Unlike Perakslis' suggested network and registry model, the Exceptional Responders Initiative runs more like a clinical trial. Patients who have demonstrated an exceptional response to any modality — experimental or no — are welcome, but must fit strict criteria before molecular characterization takes place.
So far, says Zenklusen, 57 of the 154 patients who have been accepted into the program have begun to have their genomes analyzed.
At first, says Zenklusen, he saw the program as "the definition of a fishing expedition. We were accepting all tissues, all comers, all therapies. Every single case is a world on its own. But we actually are finding a lot."
Out of the approximately 30 cases that have complete molecular characterizations, he says, at least 12 have yielded clear combinations of genes that make it obvious why patients have responded to certain treatments.
"It's the mother of all fishing expeditions," he adds, "but we have found the whale."
Zenklusen says that it's premature to pursue a networked registry model like the one Perakslis suggests.
"It's a little too early, but we are not too far away," he says. "Unfortunately, when we find something that is interesting, we tend to get very excited. Cancer is a horrible disease. But sometimes we communicate the information a little too enthusiastically."
He worries that leaping toward a national registry before it's been firmly established that exceptional responders really have smoking guns tucked into their genome could mislead the public into thinking that personalized, precision cures for cancer are just around the corner.
"No one knows the winning formula here," admits Perakslis. For him, the challenge is data density — which makes it even more urgent to collect as much data from exceptional responders as possible.
Cures may still be far in the future, he says, but that's no reason not to look hard at patients who respond dramatically to treatment now. "(There are) so many cancers, subtypes, unique patients, potential treatments," he says. "It is like trying to paint the sky."
