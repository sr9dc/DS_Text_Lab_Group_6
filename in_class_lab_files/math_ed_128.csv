Controversy exists regarding transfer from musical training to math achievements. The current study examined the effect of two integrated intervention programs representing holistic versus acoustic approaches, on fraction knowledge. Three classes of fourth graders attended 12 lessons on fractions: One class attended the 'MusiMath' holistic program (n = 30) focusing on rhythm within the melody. Another class attended the 'Academic Music' acoustic program (Courey et al., Educ Stud Math 81:251, 2012) (n = 25) which uses rhythm only. The third class received regular fraction lessons (comparison group, n = 22). Students in both music programs learned to write musical notes and perform rhythmic patterns through clapping and drumming as part of their fraction lessons. They worked toward adding musical notes to produce a number (fraction), and created addition/subtraction problems with musical notes. The music programs used a 4/4 time signature with whole, half, quarter and eighth notes. In the math lessons, the students learned the analogy between musical durations and 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 fractions, but also practiced fractions other than 1/2, 1/4, 1/8. Music and math were assessed before, immediately following, and 3- and 6-months post-intervention. Pre- to post-intervention analyses indicated that only the 'MusiMath' group showed greater transfer to intervention-trained and untrained fractions than the comparison group. The 'Academic Music' group showed a trend on trained fractions. Although both music groups outperformed the comparison group 3- and 6-months post-intervention on trained fractions, only the 'MusiMath' group demonstrated greater gains in untrained fractions. Gains were more evident in trained than in untrained fractions. A video abstract of this article can be viewed at https://youtu.be/uJ_KWWDO624",,

Analysis indicated a significantly better gain by the experimental group on the PASA-2 measure of awareness of pattern and structure and on the PASA-Sp assessment of spatial ability at the post-SRMP period. However, there were no significant differences found between groups on the PATMaths4 test of mathematics achievement.

Whereas most mathematics assignments consist of a block of problems devoted to the same skill or concept, an interleaved assignment is arranged so that no two consecutive problems require the same strategy. Previous small-scale studies found that practice assignments with a greater proportion of interleaved practice produced higher test scores. In the present study, we assessed the efficacy and feasibility of interleaved practice in a naturalistic setting with a large, diverse sample. Each of 54 seventh-grade mathematics classes periodically completed interleaved or blocked assignments over a period of four months, and then both groups completed an interleaved review assignment. One month later, students took an unannounced test, and the interleaved group outscored the blocked group, 61% vs. 38%, d = 0.83. Teachers were able to implement the intervention without training, and they later expressed support for interleaved practice in an anonymous survey they completed before they knew the results of the study. Although important caveats remain, the results suggest that interleaved mathematics practice is effective and feasible.

Data were available for 33 interventionists serving 658 students in Grades 4-6 across one school year. A series of multilevel models were fit to the data to evaluate the impact of procedural IF and interventionists' math content knowledge on students' postintervention achievement, controlling for preintervention achievement and intervention dosage. Higher student posttest scores were observed for interventionists with an average fidelity rating of 95% or greater (ß = 0.15); however, no effects on students' math achievement scores were observed for interventionist content knowledge. Adding IF and a measure of interventionist content knowledge to the model explained a statistically significant amount of variance in growth estimates attributable to interventionists (15%). Results highlight the potential importance of ongoing evaluation and remediation of IF in the context of standardized supplemental intervention in math, while also providing some evidence that higher levels of content knowledge may not translate into greater impact in a standard-protocol intervention setting. Results suggest a need for more research examining characteristics of interventionists and aspects of implementation that may account for variance in student outcomes.",,

The unfortunate consequence of this procedural variability is that it is difficult to determine whether differences in obtained results across studies are attributable to the way in which behavior was measured or actual intervention effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to comparatively evaluate the most commonly used observational methods for monitoring the effects of classwide interventions in terms of the degree to which obtained data represented actual behavior. The 5 most common sampling methods were identified and evaluated against a criterion generated by averaging across observations conducted on 14 students in one seventh-grade classroom. Results suggested that the best approximation of mean student engagement was obtained by observing a different student during each consecutive 15-s interval whereas observing an entire group of students during each interval underestimated the mean level of behavior within a phase and the degree of behavior change across phases. In contrast, when observations were restricted to the 3 students with the lowest levels of engagement, data revealed greater variability in engagement across baseline sessions and suggested a more notable change in student behavior subsequent to intervention implementation.",,

Students' conceptualizations (task definitions) of the problem, self-regulatory processes, and mathematics achievement were then compared across the 2 conditions. To measure task definitions of the mathematics problem, students developed concept maps of the problem using a tablet application. To capture self-regulatory processes, students were asked to think out loud as they solved the problem. Results revealed that students in the learning by preparing to teach intervention developed a more detailed and better-organized concept map of the problem compared with students in the control condition. Students in the learning by preparing to teach intervention also engaged in more metacognitive processing strategies and had higher levels of mathematics problem solving achievement compared with students in the control condition. No differences were found, however, in planning and goal setting or in use of cognitive strategies across the 2 conditions. Implications of this research suggest students' initial task definitions may be a key factor in differences found when learning by teaching compared with solely learning for learning.",,

The two studies address how narrative-based transmedia curricular resources can support student learning in early mathematics. The studies were designed to identify the affordances (features and advantages) of transmedia-based learning in preschool and first grade classrooms. Study 1 included a 4-week intervention, where students interacted with 16 digital learning games featuring the popular Curious George animated character, hands-on materials downloaded from a Curious George public media website, three Curious George video episodes, and books and other common classroom materials. Sixty-eight preschool children were recruited from a school serving low-income communities in the San Francisco Bay Area that took part in the intervention. Measures included rigorous assessments of mathematics ability. Other data collection included classroom observations, and interviews with participating teachers. Over the course of the intervention, children's knowledge of mathematics increased significantly, as measured by the Test of Early Mathematics Ability. Results of qualitative data analysis suggest that the transmedia aspect of the intervention brought affordances to students' learning experiences. Study 2 involved an intervention with first grade students that included narrative-based digital and non-digital learning resources from the popular Odd Squad public television series. During the study, participating students used a school-based intervention that included videos, online games, interstitials, and hands-on activities from an Odd Squad transmedia suite. Four first grade teachers from the San Francisco Bay Area and their classrooms (n = 83 first grade students and their families) participated in the study. Measures included verbal and written assessments of mathematics ability. Other data collection included interviews with participating teachers and parents. Over the course of the Odd Squad intervention, students' overall knowledge of mathematics in the domains of Number and Operations and Algebraic Thinking increased significantly, as well as their competency with mathematics vocabulary and the concept of fact families. Results of qualitative data analysis of teacher and parent interview data suggest that the transmedia aspect of the intervention brought affordances to first grade students' learning experiences, including an engaging narrative domain to spur student motivation, presentation of content across multiple modalities, and supportive game-based learning.",,

Math training focused primarily on basic arithmetic (addition and subtraction facts up to 12), and secondarily on number knowledge and word problems. We investigated the moderating effects of IQ and socioeconomic factors, and additive effects of working memory (WM) training. A representative sample of 283 low performing second-grade students were randomly assigned to control (n = 52), reading placebo (n = 78), math intervention (MA; n = 76), or math plus WM training (MA + WM; n = 77). Both math conditions scored significantly higher than control and placebo on the posttest of basic arithmetic, but not on arithmetic transfer and problem solving. WM training did not show additive effects. Given the virtually identical patterns, we collapsed the control and placebo, respectively, MA and MA + WM conditions. The collapsed MA/MA + WM condition demonstrated significant medium-sized effects (d = 0.53-0.67) on basic arithmetic compared with the collapsed control/placebo condition at posttest. There was a fadeout of effects at 6-month follow-up (d = 0.18-0.28), that declined further at 12 months (d = 0.03-0.13). IQ was a significant moderator of direct and long-term effects on addition up to 12 and subtraction up to 18, where students with lower IQ benefitted more than higher IQ students. Socioeconomic factors did not moderate outcome. The intervention effectively improved basic arithmetic among low performing second graders. Although the effects waned at 6-month follow-up, there was some indication that children with lower IQ demonstrated sustained gains. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: This study shows that adaptive math training on tablet can help low performing 8-year-olds catch up about half a year of schooling in critical math skills. Students with lower IQ benefitted in particular and made long-term gains 12 months after training finished. Additional short-term memory training did not result in further math improvement. Because math is a strong predictor of later school achievement, these findings highlight the potential of well-designed adaptive teaching on tablets to significantly improve students' success at school. Evidence-based programs covering the bulk of elementary math might be widely spread, potentially at a low cost.",,

Wondering how he could support understanding and use of content and practice standards embodied in the CCSS-M while attending to students' unique strengths and weaknesses is addressed with a three step approach that includes: (1) Problem Identification; (2) Analyzing the Problem; and (3) Implementing a Solution. To intensify instruction for students with and without disabilities, teachers need a process to diagnostically assess students' current levels of understanding of mathematical concepts, determine areas of priority, conceptualize instructional tasks, and monitor performance. This article offers ongoing and robust diagnostic assessments to plan and implement evidence-based interventions and resources that address specific conceptual or procedural gaps in knowledge for individual students. This framework also guides teachers and interventionists to identify the problem or concern for students in terms of their mathematics understanding, analyze why the problem is occurring, implement a plan to address the problem, and evaluate if the plan is resulting in increased student performance.",,

Recent research suggests that sociocultural factors account for differences across genders in the acquisition of these foundational skills. In this study, we investigated whether a new technology-based intervention, that included activities accessible to both boys and girls, can reduce gender differences from emerging during the early primary school years. The novel instructional method used in this study employed apps developed by onebillion© delivered individually through touch-screen tablets. Over a series of experiments conducted in Malawi, a low-income country in sub-Sahara Africa, we found that when children were exposed to standard pedagogical practice typical gender differences emerged over the first grade (Experiment 1). In contrast, boys and girls learnt equally well with the new interactive apps designed to support the learning of mathematics (Experiment 2) and reading (Experiment 3). When implemented at the start of primary education, before significant gender discrepancies become established, this novel technology-based intervention can prevent significant gender effects for mathematics.

Fractions intervention focused on magnitude understanding and word problems. Embedded SR was designed to support a growth mindset (fostering belief that intellectual and academic abilities can be developed) along with SR processes in which students set goals, self-monitor, and use strategies to engage motivationally, metacognitively, and behaviorally through challenging tasks. Students (n = 69) were randomly assigned to business-as-usual control and the two versions of fractions intervention. Multilevel models, accounting for the nested structure of the data, identified a moderation effect on fraction word problems: For students receiving fractions intervention with embedded SR, response to intervention was robust across the continuum of students' pretest word problem skill; by contrast, without SR, response to fractions intervention depended on students' pretest word problem skill. On the remaining outcomes, results reflected stronger outcomes when fractions intervention embedded SR instruction without moderation.

In congruent trials (no interference), accuracy is higher and reaction time is shorter than in incongruent trials (area variable interference). A brain-imaging study related to this task indicated that correctly answering the incongruent condition is associated with activation in prefrontal brain regions known for their executive inhibitory control. These findings suggested that intervention aimed at activating inhibitory control mechanisms could improve students' success. In this paper, we explore the effect of an intervention that explicitly warns about the possible interference of the variable ""area."" Eighty-four sixth graders performed the same comparison of perimeters reaction time test, with warning intervention (warning group) or without it (control group). Accuracy in the warning group was significantly higher in incongruent conditions and reaction time was significantly longer in all conditions than in the control group. The results suggest that the explicit warning activates inhibitory control mechanisms and thus helps students overcome the interference. The findings point to the possibility of improving students' problem-solving abilities through simple and focused interventions that explicitly warn them about the trap in the task.

Data for 440 children, including controls, show that children receiving Catch Up Numeracy intervention attained average gains more than twice that expected of typically attaining children, and more than twice that attained by children receiving non-targeted mathematics support. The evidence suggests that Catch Up Numeracy is effective for children who are low-attaining in mathematics.

The games involved declarative, procedural, as well as conceptual knowledge of multiplicative relations, and were accompanied with teacher-led lessons and class discussions. A pretest-posttest control-group design was employed, with 81 students from five schools for special primary education (three experimental schools and two control schools). The intervention consisted of two 10-week game periods in which a total of 16 mini-games were offered as part of the regular educational program for multiplicative reasoning. The control group students played non-multiplicative mini-games; for multiplicative reasoning, they followed their regular educational program without mini-games. In both groups, students' multiplicative reasoning ability significantly increased. Regarding declarative knowledge of multiplication facts, learning outcomes were significantly higher in the experimental group as compared with the control group. This finding indicates the usefulness of mini-games for enhancing special education students' mathematics fact knowledge. Learning outcomes on a test measuring procedural and conceptual knowledge of multiplicative reasoning did not differ between experimental and control group. For these learning outcomes, then, the mini-games intervention did not have added value but can still be considered a ""safe"" alternative approach.",,

Whole-number calculation skill, domain-general abilities (working memory, attentive behavior, processing speed, listening comprehension), and fraction proficiency were pretested. Intervention occurred for 12 weeks, 3 times per week, 30 min per session, and then fraction performance was reassessed. On each conceptual and procedural fraction outcome, effects favored intervention over control (effect sizes = 0.29 to 2.50), and the gap between at-risk and low-risk students narrowed for the intervention group but not the control group. Improvement in the accuracy of children's measurement interpretation of fractions mediated intervention effects. Also, intervention effects were moderated by domain-general abilities, but not whole-number calculation skill.",R324C100004,HD15052

Thus, for pupils to carry out a computation, such as a written calculation, metacognitive mechanisms play a crucial role, since children must employ self-regulation to assess the precision of their own thinking and performance. This assessment, in turn, can be helpful in the regulation of their own learning. In this regard, a body of literature suggests that the application of psychoeducational interventions that promote the development of mathematics-related metacognitive (e.g., control) processes, based on the analysis of the students' errors, can successfully influence mathematics performance. The main objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of a metacognitive and cognitive training program developed to enhance various arithmetic skills (e.g., syntax, mental and written calculation), self-regulatory and control functions in primary and secondary school students exhibiting atypical mathematical development. Sixty-eight Italian children, 36 male and 32 female (mean age at pretest = 9.3 years, SD = 1.02 years), meeting the criteria for the diagnosis of dyscalculia or specific difficulties in mathematics, took part in the study. Of these, 34 children (i.e., experimental group) underwent the cognitive and self-regulatory intervention enhancing mathematics skills training for 16 weekly sessions. The remaining students were assigned to the control group. For a pre-test and post-test, a battery of standardized mathematical tests assessing different mathematics skills, such as written and mental operations, digit transcription and number ordering skills, was administered and provided a series of measures of calculation time and accuracy (i.e., number of errors). In the post-test, the experimental group exhibited better accuracy in written calculation and in digit transcription. Overall, the current outcomes demonstrate that psychoeducational interventions enriching metacognitive and mathematical achievements through error analysis may be an effective way to promote both the development of self-regulatory and control skills and mathematical achievement in children with atypical mathematical development.",,

Results indicated that IR led to significantly more facts being retained, and was essentially equal to TD for efficiency as measured by number of facts retained per instructional minute. Memory scores accounted for 34% of the variance beyond mathematics calculation scores in retention of multiplication facts for the TD condition, but only 2% of the variance for the IR condition. Thus, retention of multiplication facts seems largely influenced by a student's memory skills when using less effective instructional techniques such as TD, while approaches like IR are likely effective regardless of memory skills. Impact and Implications: The current study found that Incremental Rehearsal (IR) was more effective than traditional drill (TD) in helping students retain multiplication facts, and the 2 interventions were equally efficient. However, retention of multiplication facts seems was largely influenced by the student's memory skills when using the less effective TD approach, and IR was effective regardless of memory skills. It may be more effective for practitioners to use an intervention that works despite memory difficulties than to base interventions on measures of memory for individual students.",,

A statistically significant positive effect was found on one of five outcome measures, with the other four showing positive but nonsignificant results. Results also suggested preliminary evidence of differential response based on students' number sense and early literacy risk status. Implications for using mathematics interventions focused on measurement and data analysis to build comprehensive, multitiered service delivery models in mathematics are discussed.",1503161,

The sample consisted of German/Turkish bilingual students (n = 128) in Grade 7 in German schools without prior formal mathematics education in Turkish. In a randomized control trial, the bilingual intervention was compared to the corresponding monolingual intervention and a control group. A repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that students in both interventions had significantly higher learning gains than in the control group, and in fact profited equally from both interventions, although some time and effort was required for overcoming initial barriers in the home language and especially in the academic register. A qualitative analysis of the videotaped bilingual learning processes revealed insights into specific obstacles and chances of connecting both languages in order to foster conceptual understanding. The students with some formal language proficiency in Turkish seemed to profit even more from the bilingual intervention, but a rigid technical register was not necessary.",,

Solving word problems proves particularly challenging for students with mathematics difficulties because skill in reading, interpretation of language, and mathematics are required for word-problem proficiency. We examined whether two versions of a word-problem intervention increased students' understanding of three word-problem language features: naming a superordinate category, identifying irrelevant information, and providing a word-problem label. At pre- and posttest, 145 3rd-grade students solved word problems and answered questions about word-problem language. Students who participated in the word-problem interventions demonstrated improvement on identifying irrelevant information and providing word-problem labels over students in the business-as-usual condition. We did not identify group differences related to naming a superordinate category.

This means that students know which strategy is needed to solve each problem before they read the problem. In an alternative approach known as ""interleaved practice,"" problems from the course are rearranged so that a portion of each assignment includes different kinds of problems in an interleaved order. Interleaved practice requires students to choose a strategy on the basis of the problem itself, as they must do when they encounter a problem during a comprehensive examination or subsequent course. In the experiment reported here, 126 seventh-grade students received the same practice problems over a three-month period, but the problems were arranged so that skills were learned by interleaved practice or by the usual blocked approach. The practice phase concluded with a review session, followed 1 or 30 days later by an unannounced test.
