## Topic
For our Lab we decided to do a sentiment analysis of newspapers chosen by the keyword "Data Science". 

We further filtered our data to be based on geographic regions of our choosing in the United States, and decided to include the top 100 results of all time, because in certain regions the history of the topic of data science was variable (West Coast vs. Midwest)

The 3 Regions we chose on the LexisNexis site were:

* West Coast: Alaska or Arizona or California or Colorado or Hawaii or Idaho or Montana or Nevada or New Mexico or Oregon or Utah or Washington or Wyoming
* Midwest: Illinois or Indiana or Iowa or Kansas or Michigan or Minnesota or Missouri or Nebraska or North Dakota or Ohio or Wisconsin
* East Coast: Maine or New Hampshire or Massachusetts or Rhode Island or Connecticut or New York or New Jersey or Delaware or Maryland or Virginia or North Carolina or South Carolina or Georgia or Florida

We then further chose Newspapers for each region, and then filtered by the top 100 results in the database:

* West Coast: Los Angeles Times, Eurasia, Spokesman
* Midwest: Chicago Daily Herald, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)
* East Coast: New York Times, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Spokesman Review

Based on our sentiment analysis, we found a little more negative sentiment than positive sentiment about the topic of "Data Science". After running tf-idfs, our initial "Data Science" keyword did have an impact on the topics that came out afterward. Interestingly enough, the words "school" and "college" are mentioned, which could be referring to an increase in data science education offerings in the regions we selected.
