The U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command issued the following story:
The renowned theoretical physicist, Stephen Hawking once said, "Computers will overtake humans with Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the next 100 years. When that happens, we need to make sure the computers have goals aligned with ours." Likewise, what most frequently drives AI in this day and age is data science and according to Hawking this is a big part of cyberspace with its own set of difficulty. "In a dazzlingly complex world, you have to be able to discern the meaning in the mess. We are, in a figurative and literal sense, awash with what we call data."
"What we're only now fully realizing is two-fold: the sheer quantity of data in any given domain; and the tools we need to make use of the information encoded in it," said Hawking.
As the U.S. Army continues to operate in a heavily contested cyber environment, the Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) is using data as a means to gain a strategic digital advantage over our cyberspace adversaries while synchronously applying data science to influence AI and gain foresight that achieves a domineering tactical advantage within any Joint Area of Operations (JOA) that requires data-centric network enterprise support.
Furthermore, cyber security analysists often refer to data as the weapon of choice when addressing cyber threats by both peer and state sponsored adversaries.
"From a cybersecurity standpoint, the volume and velocity of threat and vulnerability data make it very difficult for analysts unaided by data science to secure the network or recognize and respond to threats," said Col. Eric S. Tollefson, NETCOM Director of Data Science.
Using data science to influence DoD's inherent battlespace across all echelons of the Joint All Domain Operations (JADO) environment is not a new concept; thus, the Department of Defense (DoD) is currently unleashing data to advance the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and Digital Modernization (DM) initiatives. Presently, the DoD Data Strategy provides overarching vision, focus areas, guiding principles, essential capabilities and goals necessary to transform the Department into data-centric enterprise.
Supporting DoD's data-centric enterprise initiative is the NETCOM Data Science Directorate (DSD) via the Army's Data Plan.
"Although, the Army does not have a Data Science Strategy per-say, it does have the Army Data Plan and its corresponding HQDA EXORD 009-20, Army Data Plan Implementation in Support of Cloud Migration, as well as The Enterprise Data Analytics Strategy for Army Business: 2018-2022," said Tollefson.
"As consumers of data, the DSD supports the Army Data Plan by developing data requirements essential to operationalize data science at NETCOM, which in turn helps the data management and governance bodies prioritize their efforts. With the addition of the NETCOM data management function to DSD's portfolio, we now also directly support that plan by implementing data management at the NETCOM level," added Tollefson.
According to Tollefson, the NETCOM DSD also directly supports other key Army and DoD initiatives focused on AI and Machine Learning (ML).
Nevertheless, as so happens with any inter-disciplinary field, data science remains a highly analytical and practical science that often has its share of challenges.
"For any given problem, we struggle with finding the necessary data (visibility), getting to the data (accessibility), knowing what's in the data source (understandability), and having high quality data (trustworthiness)," says Tollefson.
"There are scores of examples we could point out. We spend a large portion of our time dealing with data-related challenges. However, that's not unusual from what data scientists from elsewhere in the Army and DoD, as well as in industry, face; dealing with data issues is simply part of the process," added Tollefson.
NETCOM's DSD focuses its mission on providing integrated and advanced analytics capabilities in order to enable objective decision-making. In addition, to meet mission requirements and to maintain a technological edge over peer-to-peer adversaries, the NETCOM DSD maintains an emphasis on its Lines of Effort, which include providing data analytics products and services, maximizing use of enterprise data, developing partnerships, building capabilities and managing talent.
"We have also recently picked up the mission to lead data management across the command. We have begun work on implementing that capability; however, this is still a work in progress," emphasized Tollefson.
Not only has the NETCOM DSD remained postured and engaged with providing the command data science expertise, the directorate has made great strides in collaborating with the Army, DoD and institutions of higher learning during COVID-19.
"Throughout COVID, DSD coordinated, collaborated and connected in a distributed manner due to our organizational structure," added Tollefson.
"In addition to our main body at Ft Huachuca, we are operating small offices in three satellite locations across the country (Phoenix, Monterey, and Pittsburgh), which were stood up for the purpose of partnering with academia and industry and providing access to the highly qualified talent pools of those major metropolitan areas."
"Moreover, in order to work together seamlessly, we had to implement tools and develop processes for collaboration that prepared us well for the COVID-19 environment. The tools implemented by DoD and the Army during COVID-19 led to even greater improvements in our ability to communicate. Data science is absolutely a team sport, and collaboration is critical," explained Tollefson.
Nevertheless, keeping a team like the DSD working flawlessly through a global pandemic and operating with the parameters of a heavily contested cyber environment often takes a group of winners and over-achievers with the technical expertise to meet the challenges of sustaining a data science eco-system that not only supports the U.S. Amy but the DoD as well. So in order to maintain a dominating competitive posture, the team often competes in Army and DoD wide competitions designed to showcase the limitless talents of this unique NETCOM organization.
Although, officially established in 2017, the DSD team has hit the ground winning accolades in several competitions and recognition throughout the Army and DoD.
"DSD placed first in the Data Visualization category during the 1st Army Analyst Data Challenge (AADC) in 2019. That year, winners were selected from two categories - Data Visualization and Predictive Model. The visualization category judged how well teams represented their information and results for decision makers," recalled Tollefson.
Equally, in 2020 the team also competed and placed in the AADC competition as well; however, balancing duties, COVID-19, remote operations and staying in-tune with real-world threats took a heavy toll on the team.
"Access to software and tools was and is the consistent problem. Each member did work on their local machine and it was not always easy, or possible to share work with one another due to accessibility issues," said Lt. Col. Robert N. Collier, Senior Data Scientist at the NETCOM Phoenix Data Science Center (DSC).
"This is a very broad problem that is being earnestly worked on in the Army and elsewhere in the DoD. In short, it sounds easy, but one of the biggest challenges is that it is not easy / possible to either bring the data to the tools, or vice versa. Thus, if an individual can do it on their local machine, others in their group may not be able to do the same," emphasized Collier.
With limited remote access to much needed software tools and external user constraints, the team remained unable to achieve the same success as the year prior.
"We came in third of over 30 teams. The top two teams did exceptional work, and deserve their due credit," recalled Collier.
Other team members had this to say; "This was a very good finish, given the challenges with data and the data science environment along with ongoing project work. Last but not least getting to know and interact with like-minded team members was a significant plus that I really enjoyed," said Tina Agarwal, Data Scientist at the NETCOM Pittsburgh, DSC.
According to the DSD AADC competition team lead, Maj. Nicholas L. Lee also echoed some of Collier's thoughts regarding last year's competition trials and tribulations.
"I think the greatest challenges these data science competitions bring to the table is the fact that they try to implement realistic constraints that exceed the teams to ability to collaborate across domains, locations, services, etc.," evoked Lee.
"Remote collaboration is not an easy task, especially on complex problem sets. Fortunately for us, we are satellite based, and fully embraced this challenge by selecting members, who accustomed themselves to work from remote spots rather than operate close to the flagpole [brick and mortar locations] as they say in the Army," recounted Lee.
Although challenged last year during the AADC competition, DSD team members found comradery as they explored innovative ways to problem-solve and articulate difficult project-sets during the contest.
"There are so many different, and creative ways to tackle a problem and being afforded the opportunity to participate in the 2020 AADC is a fantastic learning experience for me. Not to mention, the fact that we have a geographically dispersed team, having the chance to work alongside other Data Scientists that I don't necessarily get to work with on a regular basis is another added benefit," said Chris Fearnow, NETCOM Operations Research Analyst.
"I think NETCOM is a great organization, and the people work well together. And as far as the DSD is concerned, we are a tight knit group of individuals, who share knowledge, teach, mentor and progress in the data science field on a daily basis. Teamwork like this is often hard to find elsewhere," added Lee.
Respectively, for a data science team like the NETCOM DSD that knows no bounds and has no limitations when it comes to its personnel and their diversified talents; there is no problem they cannot solve. And this assertiveness is frequently voiced quite persuasively by the team members themselves.
"I like how data science leverages skills in engineering, statistics and domain expertise as part of the problem that one is trying to solve. Though it's difficult to excel in all the areas, one can find a niche and work towards more specialized roles like a Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer and Architect," said Agarwal.
"I believe the challenge in data science revolves around data itself, especially when the data is messy and not available in the right format. However, I like the ability to research and collaborate as part of a small team and having the freedom and opportunity to overcome challenges in creative ways," highlighted Agarwal.
As data competitions maintain skillsets and multi-talented personnel help integrate and extrapolate data management tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP's), the NETCOM DSD Team is remaining postured and ready to enable a data-driven enterprise that is fully capable of optimizing and transforming the Army's portion of the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN-A). This stance also allows NETCOM to sustain uninhibited support of Army and DoD data science initiatives. This comportment then translates into a DSD team that is prepositioned to meet the new challenges of the information age.
"The Army is currently moving from the industrial age to the information age, leveraging data as a strategic asset. The work we do is fundamental to that transformation in the cyber domain," said Tollefson.
"NETCOM leaders past and present have recognized that data science and data management are integral to how the Army will fight, and DSD is at the cutting edge of that. Furthermore, we are a self-learning organization, continually re-evaluating how we do things to ensure that we evolve as both NETCOM and the cyber domain evolve."
"Additionally, we employ agile processes that focus on delivering value quickly and iteratively to the customer, providing greater operational flexibility and adaptability to a changing environment," recapped Tollefson.

Tableau has introduced Business Science, a new class of AI-powered analytics that lowers the barrier to data science techniques, enabling business users and analysts to make smarter decisions faster. In a market where agility is the ultimate competitive advantage, Business Science empowers more people with data, with simplified model creation, predictions, what-if scenarios, forecasting and other analytical methods - all using clicks, not code.

Tableau will deliver Einstein Discovery in its 2021.1 update later this month, the first major release enabling Business Science. Integrating Einstein Discovery's trusted, real-time predictions and recommendations into Tableau will help people go beyond understanding what happened and why it happened, to explore likely business outcomes and inform proactive action. For more than five years, Einstein Discovery has helped Salesforce customers surface insights and understand patterns across millions of rows of data in minutes, without requiring sophisticated data models.

"Today, data science is out of reach for most business users. Business analysts have relied on data scientists to extract powerful, precise insights using sophisticated models. But getting to those insights can be complex, expensive and time consuming," said Chandana Gopal, research director, future of intelligence, IDC. "While data science can unlock powerful insights, there is sometimes a trade-off between precision and time-to-insight. Business Science recognizes that trade-off and seeks to make data science accessible and actionable for more people."

Business Science will elevate the work of both data scientists and advanced analysts.

"Data science has always been able to solve big problems but too often that power is limited to a few select people within an organization," said Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer, Tableau. "To build truly data-driven organizations, we need to unlock the power of data for as many people as possible. Democratizing data science will help more people make smarter decisions faster."

Customers can use Business Science to improve supply chain efficiency, predict likelihood of purchase or maximize delivery of goods or services, for example. Data science could help with vaccine research and development, while Business Science could help with distribution and get shots in people's arms.

"Machine Learning platforms like Einstein Discovery are the next frontier in democratizing data science," said Siddharth Dayama, senior manager of data analytics, Verizon. "Einstein Discovery integrated into Tableau brings predictive capabilities to the existing inventory of dashboards companies already have, and when that's combined with auto-generated machine learning models, businesses can explore patterns, trends and correlations in their historical data without writing a single line of code. Layering ML/AI capabilities on existing BI infrastructure opens up a world of possibilities in day-to-day business problem solving."

New Delhi, March 29 -- Job opportunities and salaries in data science have boomed in India, as the pandemic-driven digital transformation boosts demand for high-end skills.
Data science professionals with 3-10 years of experience get annual salaries in the Rs.25-65 lakh range, while those with more experience can command pay packages upwards of Rs.1 crore, according to recruitment firm Michael Page's 2021 India Talent Trends report. Experts with more than 15 years of experience can get paid up to Rs.1.8 crore, it said.
Companies are hiring data science professionals to help capture various types of data and derive meaningful insights from them.
This can often be a complex process; hence, employers are willing to offer high salaries to data scientists and data engineers.
"The demand for data science professionals is at an all-time high, and the supply hasn't been able to catch up, leading to an acute shortage of talent. Firms are willing to pay a premium, along with other benefits and long-term incentives, in order to attract and retain employees-leading to an increase in the overall compensation levels," said Karan Madhok, associate director, Michael Page India.
The main difference between data engineers and data scientists is one of focus. While data engineers are involved in building the infrastructure and architecture for data generation, data scientists are mainly concerned with performing advanced mathematics and statistical analysis on the collected data.
"Rapid growth and demand in digital transformation and advanced analytics have led to a surge in demand for data science professionals in key technology areas such as artificial intelligence, analytics, internet of things, blockchain and quantum computing," said Saran Balasundaram, founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Han Digital, a talent consulting company.
"As more and more companies move to the cloud, the need for data science and engineering talent will further increase."
The shortage of skills in data science is evident from how long it takes to find such professionals.
"The time taken to hire engineers in general is six-to-eight weeks, while the time to hire data scientists is 11-12 weeks. Also, the starting salary for data science professionals is 15-20% higher than other roles in engineering," said Anshuman Das, cofounder and CEO of talent acquisition company CareerNet.
Data science professionals also command better salary hikes both internally and during job changes.
"When changing jobs, generally people demand 25-30% hike, but data scientists demand a 35-45% hike. The average annual pay hike for them falls between 20-30% compared with 15-20% for the rest of the employees," Das added.
As people try to upskill themselves in high-demand jobs, Jigsaw Academy, an institute for data science training, has seen a 50% increase in the enrolment rate for its data science programs in the last 12 months.
"Data and its manipulation is a formidable arsenal that businesses possess. With advanced technologies, organizations are slowly but steadily becoming data-driven," said Gaurav Vohra, co-founder and CEO, Jigsaw Academy.
Data science-related courses are also gaining popularity at B-schools as employers prefer to hire management graduates with technical skills.
"Courses on business analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are the most popular courses among IIM-B students. It helps them target core analytics companies as well as those that look for a combination of analytics and management skills during placements," said professor U. Dinesh Kumar, chairperson, MBA in business analytics, IIM Bangalore.
While demand for data science experts has grown across sectors, IT services companies employ the majority (40%) of the data science talent pool in India, followed by global in-house centres or captives in India with a 30% market share, according to Han Digital.

"While data science can unlock powerful insights, there is sometimes a trade-off between precision and time-to-insight. Business Science recognizes that trade-off and seeks to make data science accessible and actionable for more people."
Business Science will elevate the work of both data scientists and advanced analysts.
"Data science has always been able to solve big problems but too often that power is limited to a few select people within an organization," said Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer, Tableau. "To build truly data-driven organizations, we need to unlock the power of data for as many people as possible. Democratizing data science will help more people make smarter decisions faster."
Customers can use Business Science to improve supply chain efficiency, predict likelihood of purchase or maximize delivery of goods or services, for example. Data science could help with vaccine research and development, while Business Science could help with distribution and get shots in people's arms.
"Machine Learning platforms like Einstein Discovery are the next frontier in democratizing data science," said Siddharth Dayama, senior manager of data analytics, Verizon. "Einstein Discovery integrated into Tableau brings predictive capabilities to the existing inventory of dashboards companies already have, and when that's combined with auto-generated machine learning models, businesses can explore patterns, trends and correlations in their historical data without writing a single line of code. Layering ML/AI capabilities on existing BI infrastructure opens up a world of possibilities in day-to-day business problem solving."
Additional capabilities available in 2021.1 include:
New Microsoft Azure Connectivity Improvements allow people to connect to their data in Azure SQL Database (with Azure Active Directory) and Azure Data Lake Gen 2. Tableau also now supports Azure Active Directory in two existing connectors, Azure Synapse and Azure Databricks. A new Extension Gallery helps people easily search for and discover connectors and dashboard extensions within Tableau. From the gallery, customers can easily discover and install connectors and dashboard extensions that add functionality to their dashboards and connectors that enable Tableau to access additional databases and applications, within their Tableau workflow. A redesigned notification experience displays a Tableau user's shares, comments, extracts and prep flows together in one dedicated space. This communicates all important changes across the organization. People can choose where to receive these notifications — directly in Tableau, email or both — ensuring they're aware of important alerts or updates. Quicker, easier Level of Detail (LOD) expressions let people use context menus or drag-and-drop a measure onto a dimension to automatically create a Level of Detail expression with the default aggregation. A new Salesforce Customer 360 Audiences Connector natively connects Tableau to Customer 360 Audiences, uncovering insights in detailed customer data. With the new connector, Tableau customers can explore by campaign, channel and multiple customer dimensions to understand the 'who' and 'why' behind their cross-channel engagement results.

With the launch of a new Master of Science in Data Analytics for Science (MS-DAS) degree program, Carnegie Mellon University's Mellon College of Science (MCS) is offering a unique opportunity for students of the foundational sciences to acquire cutting-edge data science skills.
"It is a program created by scientists to equip the next generation of scientists with modern data analytics tools, machine learning skills and relevant mathematics and statistics backgrounds," said professor of physics Manfred Paulini, who spearheaded the development of the degree program in his role as MCS's associate dean for Faculty and Graduate Affairs.
What makes the MS-DAS program unique compared to other data science degree programs is its focus on students with backgrounds in the foundational sciences, including biology, physics, math, chemistry and related fields.
"Data science has permeated all aspects of scientific research in all disciplines," said Shawn Brown, director of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and a member of the working group that developed the MS-DAS program. "Even sciences that have been primarily wet-lab driven are using some form of data science for interpretation and analysis, and in order for our students to be competitive in the workforce and in their future research, it is vital that we provide training in these skills."
Students in the MS-DAS program will be able to leverage the unique expertise of PSC staff to learn vital skills such as software development, parallel computing and visualization, and they will be able to make use of PSC's advanced Bridges-2 supercomputing platform.
A key part of the degree program will be a semester-long capstone project in collaboration with industry partners, which will help students translate the competitive data science skills they've acquired into careers in academia, commercial research, government and more.
"At the Mellon College of Science, we believe that the future of science is at the interface between the foundational sciences, machine learning, engineering and data analytics," said Rebecca W. Doerge, Glen de Vries Dean of the Mellon College of Science. "Our Data Analytics for Science master's degree program will give students a solid foundation and pave the way for success in the workforce today and well into the future."

March 18: CMU's Traffic21 Announces Winners of Third Smart Mobility Challenge
Earlier this month, Carnegie Mellon University's Traffic21 announced the Township of Shaler, the City of Monessen and Heritage Community Transportation as the winners of its third Smart Mobility Challenge.
Traffic21, a research institute operated out of CMU's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy and Mobility21, its affiliated USDOT National University Transportation Center in the College of Engineering, sponsored this year's challenge as a continuation of its mission of transforming southwestern Pennsylvania into a testbed for mobility innovation.
With generous funding from the Hillman Foundation and the USDOT, the Smart Mobility Challenge invited representatives of municipalities and public transit operators in Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington and Westmoreland counties to identify real-world mobility challenges affecting their communities and apply to receive support from CMU faculty and students.
"The problems submitted for consideration illustrate the mobility challenges we face in southwestern Pennsylvania and the awareness and dedication of our local leaders and transit operators to find solutions," said Lisa Kay Schweyer, program manager of Traffic21.
Walk Bike Shaler, in partnership with the Township of Shaler, will partner with CMU researchers from the Remaking Cities Institute (RCI) to inform and contribute to the Better Boulevard Initiative. CMU, providing urban design and computer vision expertise, will deploy cameras for visual data, develop computer vision algorithms to analyze data, develop mobility/urban design recommendations from the data and respond to community priorities.
The City of Monessen, led by Mayor Matt Shorraw, will partner with CMU researchers from the RCI to inform and contribute to the ongoing work of the city's comprehensive plan and initiatives related to mobility, equity and safety with a focus on mid-downtown Monessen.
Shaler's pattern of a long Main Street in a suburban context and Monessen's pattern of a riverfront downtown are mobility/urban design case studies relevant to numerous municipalities throughout southwestern Pennsylvania and nationally.
Heritage Community Transportation, a program of Heritage Community Initiatives, will partner with CMU researchers to review the impact of COVID-19 on its services with the objective to recommend rider-focused service enhancements including service routing.
March 12: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: Online Hacking Competition Launches March 16
Carnegie Mellon University will launch its seventh picoCTF, an online cybersecurity competition run by security and privacy experts from CyLab who hope to help generate interest in the field and build a pipeline of talent.
"This competition is a great introduction to the world of cybersecurity that young students may not receive otherwise," said CyLab's Hanan Hibshi, faculty adviser to picoCTF and a teaching professor in the Information Networking Institute. "And while it serves as an intro for many, even highly skilled cybersecurity enthusiasts have gained a lot from participating."

February 19: CMU Researchers Win NSF-Amazon Fairness in AI Awards
Three Carnegie Mellon University research teams have received funding through the Program on Fairness in Artificial Intelligence, which the National Science Foundation sponsors in partnership with Amazon. The program supports computational research focused on fairness in AI, with the goal of building trustworthy AI systems that can be deployed to tackle grand challenges facing society.
"There have been increasing concerns over biases in AI systems, for example computer vision algorithms working worse for Blacks than for other races, or ads for higher paying jobs only being shown to men," said Jason Hong, a professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII). "Machine learning researchers are developing new tools and techniques to improve fairness from a quantitative perspective, but there are still many blind spots that defy pure quantification."
The CMU projects address new methods for detecting bias, translating fairness goals into public policy and increasing the diversity of people able to use systems that recognize human speech.
"Understanding how AI systems can be designed on principles of fairness, transparency and trustworthiness will advance the boundaries of AI applications," said Henry Kautz, director of the NSF's Division of Information and Intelligent Systems. "And it will help us build a more equitable society in which all citizens can be designers of these technologies as well as benefit from them."
The CMU projects selected as 2021 awardees are:
Organizing Crowd Audits To Detect Bias in Machine Learning. Led by Hong, researchers in the HCII seek to increase the diversity of viewpoints involved in identifying bias and unfairness in AI-enabled systems, in part by developing an audit system that uses crowd workers. Fair AI in Public Policy - Achieving Fair Societal Outcomes in ML Applications to Education, Criminal Justice, and Health & Human Services.
February 02: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: Nozari Receives Early Career Award
The American Psychological Association (APA) has awarded Nazbanou (Bonnie) Nozari an award for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology, in the area of human cognition and learning.
The APA cited Nozari for her "incisive experimental studies of impaired and unimpaired speakers and developing computational models of the production process [to discover] how errors in production are detected and corrected. More generally, her work provides a fresh look at how attention and control modulate language use and demonstrates the applicability of domain general computational principles of cognition to the activities of speaking, writing and typing."
"Dr. Nozari's unique interdisciplinary approach to cognition and language production combines neuropsychological testing with cutting-edges cognitive models of language processing," said Michael Tarr, the Kavcic-Moura Professor of Cognitive and Brain Science and head of the Department of Psychology. "The breadth of her work and her interest in connecting language production to other cognitive mechanisms gives our program and Dietrich College a world-class foundation from which to study human language."
Nozari, associate professor of psychology in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, has focused her research on how the brain translates abstract thoughts into words and sentences.
"You could think of [human cognition] as having unique procedures in each domain (visual processing, language processing, etc.) or you could think of the brain as having a basic set of super-computations that apply across domains and lead to what looks like efficient specialized cognition," said Nozari. "The switch from the former to the latter view is similar to exchanging lots of keys for a few master keys. Once you find the right master key, you can open many more doors and come to look at cognitive impairment through a new lens."
In addition to her research, she educates the next generation of students teaching courses at CMU.

March 26: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: Students Seeking Service Opportunities Find Virtual Groove
For decades, Carnegie Mellon University has supported alternative spring break opportunities for servant leadership. Student Leadership, Involvement and Civic Engagement (SLICE) helps Tartans travel around the world to lend their skills to communities with limited resources.
Kaycee Palko, senior coordinator of student activities at SLICE, said students typically spend the entire academic year preparing for these service trips, starting with fundraising in the fall and working through a training curriculum that includes topics such as cultural competency, voluntourism and reflection in the lead up to their trip. This year, due to the pandemic, volunteering will look a little different.
"Our students are still motivated to find a way to make a difference," Palko said.
Global Brigades, the international nonprofit that often supports these trips, found a solution for students determined to make a difference in 2021.
Three groups of CMU undergraduate students partnered with Global Brigades to offer remote business, medical and public health service to communities throughout Central America, staggered throughout the spring semester.

March 26: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: COVID-19 Vaccination Hesitancy Remains Unchanged
Daily national surveys by Carnegie Mellon University show that while COVID-19 vaccine uptake has increased, the proportion of vaccine-hesitant adults has remained unchanged. The concerns about a side effect remain high, especially among females, Black adults and those with an eligible health condition.
The Delphi Research Group at CMU in partnership with Facebook released its latest survey findings. The analyses show that vaccine hesitancy persists and point to potential tactics to combat it.
"Prior research by the CDC has found that Black and Hispanic adults are the least likely to receive the annual flu vaccine each year," said Alex Reinhart, assistant teaching professor in CMU's Department of Statistics & Data Science and a member of the Delphi Research Group. "Our survey suggests that COVID vaccine hesitancy follows a similar trend."
Reinhart was joined on this report by Facebook research scientists Esther Kim, Andy Garcia, Sarah LaRocca and Katherine Morris. Delphi staff, including statistical developer Nat DeFries and survey coordinator Wichada La Motte-Kerr, contributed to the development and analysis of the survey.
The survey tracks daily trends in behaviors and attitudes on issues related to COVID-19 at the state and county level.
March 26: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: Big Data Accelerates Biodiversity Research
Museums hold the storehouse of specimens required to understand biodiversity across the planet. These archives serve as historical snapshots of biodiversity in one area, at one time. While this information has historically remained isolated, recent efforts to digitize collections have produced a bridge between these rich troves, combining collections into a larger pool that researchers can tap to tackle deep questions about global biodiversity.
"Datasets from thousands of museums across the globe are increasingly digitized and accessible in publicly searchable, online data portals," said Mason Heberling, assistant curator of botany, co-chair of collections at Carnegie Museum of Natural History and first author on the study. "We are increasingly swimming in high volumes of data, but accessing and making sense of these data can be the limiting challenge."
Heberling consulted experts at the Digital Sciences, Humanities, Arts: Research and Publishing (dSHARP) coalition at Carnegie Mellon University. A team of faculty and staff in University Libraries and the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, dSHARP is dedicated to advancing research and teaching involving digital tools, methods and sources.
March 26: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: A Touch of Silver
In the field of robotics, metals offer advantages like strength, durability and electrical conductivity. But, they are heavy and rigid - properties that are undesirable in soft and flexible systems for wearable computing and human-machine interfaces.
Hydrogels, on the other hand, are lightweight, stretchable and biocompatible, making them excellent materials for contact lenses and tissue engineering scaffolding. They are, however, poor at conducting electricity, which is needed for digital circuits and bioelectronics applications.
Researchers in Carnegie Mellon University's Soft Machines Lab have developed a unique silver-hydrogel composite that has high electrical conductivity and is capable of delivering direct current while maintaining soft compliance and deformability. The findings were published in Nature Electronics.
The team suspended micrometer-sized silver flakes in a polyacrylamide-alginate hydrogel matrix. After going through a partial dehydration process, the flakes formed percolating networks that were electrically conductive and robust to mechanical deformations. By manipulating this dehydration and hydration process, the flakes can be made to stick together or break apart, forming reversible electrical connections.
Previous attempts to combine metals and hydrogels revealed a trade-off between improved electrical conductivity and lowered compliance and deformability.
March 19: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: And Then Oscar Came Calling. Three Nods for CMU Alumni
Two Carnegie Mellon University School of Drama alumni were nominated for three awards by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Monday, March 15. The 2021 Oscar nominations heralded Leslie Odom, Jr.'s performance for Actor in a Supporting Role as Sam Cooke in "One Night in Miami" and Original Song for "Speak Now." Legendary costume designer Ann Roth was nominated for her work in the Costume Design category for "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom." It would be Roth's second Oscar; this would be Odom, Jr.'s first.
Roth is a 1953 graduate whose work is credited in more than 200 films and theater productions. She received an honorary degree from Carnegie Mellon in 2000 and has been recognized by the university for alumni achievement. She won a Tony Award in 2013 for "The Nance" and won an Academy Award in 1996 for period costumes in "The English Patient."
"The Designs of Ann Roth," which includes more than 100 renderings and photos of her work, was released earlier this year by the United States Institute for Theatre Technology and is available online.
Leslie Odom, Jr. is a 2003 alumnus. With this nomination, he is on his way to an "EGOT," the acronym used for those who win an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award.
March 17: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: Acting in a Virtual World
For the last year, actor Whitton Frank has been immersed in virtual reality (VR). Not in her spare time as a way to pass the COVID-induced isolation period but, rather, as her profession.
Frank, a 2006 graduate of the Carnegie Mellon University BXA Intercollege Degree Programs with a bachelor of humanities and arts in drama and creative writing, puts her acting skills to use as an avatar and leads theater-goers through classics like Shakespeare's "The Tempest." It's an avenue of entertainment she never expected to pursue.
"It's been a unique experience as an actor, and one which I had never considered before," she said. "But there is an emerging world of performing in a virtual space, and the projects I've been working on have been gaining a lot of attention in media, at film festivals and with awards."

March 16: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: A New Way to Learn Computer Science
A team of Carnegie Mellon University learning scientists are developing a tool that could change the way high school teachers and students approach their computer science classes. This month Schmidt Futures announced that the team is one of the winners of their Futures Forum on Learning: Tools Competition. This prestigious award will fund tools to aid recovery from pandemic learning loss and advance the field of learning engineering.
The tool, RecapCS, was created by Ember Liu and Neil Thawani with support from John Stamper, an assistant professor in CMU's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. Liu and Thawani are both graduates of CMU's Masters of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Science (METALS) program, a year-long program that trains graduate students to become learning engineers and learning experience designers. The pair met in a METALS capstone course where they discovered a shared passion for computer science education.
Teachers and students can use the RecapCS interactive dashboard to identify problems, assess learning and lend support through a community forum.
"There is a heavy workload for teachers. It's difficult to track learning, and many teachers are not experts themselves.
March 16: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: Remembering Harold Paxton
Harold PaxtonHarold W. Paxton, former head of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, passed away on March 8, 2021 at age 94. Paxton, U.S. Steel University Professor Emeritus, had an incredible impact on MSE through his research, mentorship and leadership.

March 11: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: Anticipate the Turn
Thrust into the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the thinkers and doers at Carnegie Mellon University push on. Researchers tackle new problems as lecturers innovate unexpected ways to connect with the bright minds of tomorrow.
The late Randy Pausch, a CMU alumnus and professor, spoke about dealing with the unexpected: "We cannot change the cards we get dealt. Just how we play the hand."
Pausch said this while delivering "The Last Lecture" in 2007 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. His moving message of how to live a fulfilling life of purpose aligns with the core values the Tartan community practices to this day.
COVID-19 is the hand on the table, and the best players have a plan for when the next card is turned. The coronavirus shook the world, accelerating changes in education and technology, disrupting models in business and entertainment and fundamentally redefining how work gets done.
Looking forward, CMU experts share their thoughts on the best applications for advancements made in the past year, preparations for a post-pandemic landscape and how lessons learned can inform the future.

March 08: CMU Resources Instrumental to Musician/Entrepreneur
Oboe reeds can be a challenge for new and experienced musicians alike. The oboe is a double reed instrument whose sound is produced by two pieces of cane vibrating against each other, which can easily break or change their playability based on humidity and other factors. Manufactured cane reeds start at $15-$20, but might crack after just a few hours of playing or last little more than a month. Professional handmade reeds cost even more - or, if musicians make their own, reeds can take hours of work.
The frustration of crafting reeds led Camille Strahl to envision creating an affordable and reliable alternative.
"The technology that we use to make oboe reeds moves at a snail's pace - much the same as it was 100 years ago" said Strahl, an oboe performance graduate student in Carnegie Mellon University's School of Music and former music teacher. "I still use a razorblade to shape my material."
Last fall, Strahl took the class Business of Music, taught by Lance LaDuke. The course is part of CMU's Music Entrepreneurship program.
"I've joked for a long time about making synthetic reeds if I met an oboist who had an interest in engineering," she said. The appeal of reeds made out of plastic would make the product have more consistent playability, she said.
March 08: CMU Graduate Student Cracks Mars Rover Code
Down here on Earth, nearly 130 million miles from Mars, Adithya Balaji eagerly watched high definition video of Perseverance and its successful descent onto the red planet. From his desk in Raleigh, North Carolina, Balaji took note of the rover's parachute and its peculiar orange and white pattern. He thought it was likely functional, perhaps for aligning cameras. Within the pattern, however, lay hidden a call for humanity to continue to push out toward the unknown.
After NASA released that video - four days following Perseverance's Feb. 18 touchdown - systems engineer Allen Chen suggested during a news briefing that there was a coded message in the landing. Balaji grabbed his tablet and got to work. Hours later, a myriad of Twitter notifications drained his phone's battery after his posted solution blasted off across the internet.
"Rocketry has always been a passion of mine, and it's not every day you get a chance to solve a cryptography puzzle on another planet," said Balaji, a master's degree candidate in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. "That's the exciting thing about space. You get to see the whole world come together to solve a problem."
Every passion has an origin, and Balaji points to his parents, public television and encyclopedias as igniting his interest in the final frontier.
March 08: CMU Film Festival Showcases Chinese Film "So Long, My Son"
"So Long, My Son," the next title in the Carnegie Mellon University's International Film Festival's "Faces of Home" series, is a deep and moving generational drama from visionary Chinese director Wang Xiaoshuai that chronicles dramatic changes in the lives of two families living under China's one-child policy.
The film begins in the mid-1980s, following two close families working together in a factory in northern China. Their sons are born on the same day, as if linked by destiny. Then a tragic accident pulls the families apart. As China's dramatic social transformation generates increasing inequalities, they follow different paths both geographically and financially. Moving backwards and forwards from the accident through four decades of Chinese history, acclaimed director Xiaoshuai carefully constructs a deeply moving drama of ordinary lives and severed connections amid extraordinary social change.
"'So Long, My Son' is a testament to history - it shows how ordinary Chinese felt as they experienced shattering changes in society, family and in their personal identities," Xiaoshuai said in a statement. "To recreate all of this in this film, I revisit the 1980s all the way up through the present."
March 05: Carnegie Mellon University Federal Credit Union: SCS Names First Assistant Dean for Entrepreneurship Initiatives
Katharine "Kit" Needham has been named the inaugural assistant dean for entrepreneurship initiatives for Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science.
Needham, who also serves as the director of Project Olympus, joined Carnegie Mellon in 2008 to work on the then newly formed startup incubator with its founding director Lenore Blum.
"Even today, many people don't know what Project Olympus is," Needham said. "Hopefully, this will give a little more visibility to our programs and what we do. It sends a strong message."
Project Olympus isn't just a startup accelerator. It also serves as a sounding board for students and faculty - especially those with questions about how their ideas might translate to the market.
"What we try to do is create a safe space for students and faculty to explore the viability of their ideas at the lowest possible bar," she said.
Needham came to CMU having worked primarily in the banking industry, including stints at the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, Mellon Labs and the Allegheny Conference. It was while at the Allegheny Conference that she started looking deeper into Pittsburgh's startup community.
"That's when I met Lenore," she said.
March 05: CMU Recognized for Commitment to First-Gen Students
Carnegie Mellon has been designated a First-Gen Forward university for its commitment to improve the college experience for first-generation students. CMU received the honor from the Center for First-Generation Student Success, an initiative of NASPA - Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education and The Suder Foundation, which selected CMU into its third cohort (2021-22) of member schools.
"A commitment to first-generation students and empowering their success dates back to the founding of our institution, when Andrew Carnegie established the Carnegie Technical Schools for the sons and daughters of the steelworkers in the Pittsburgh region," said Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert. "While we have changed in many ways over those decades, and recognize we still have much work to do, the core of who we are as an institution and the transformative impact we aspire to have on individuals, communities and society as a whole has remained steadfast."
Carnegie Mellon's first-generation programs and initiatives build upon the university's efforts in diversity, equity and inclusion. Burkert said one of the most significant programs for first-gen students at CMU, which comprise more than 9% of the university's student population, is the First Together@CMU Initiative.

ABOITIZ BUSINESS UNITS TAP DATA SCIENCE TO CURB EMISSIONS & SUSTAIN PRODUCT QUALITY
InPR

Aboitiz companies Therma South, Inc. (TSI) and Republic Cement and Building Materials, Inc. (Republic Cement) are fully harnessing data science and artificial intelligence (DSAI) to create new operational efficiencies that benefit their host communities.
"We are proud of the technology that we have adopted in our TSI and Republic Cement facilities that allow us to explore new possibilities and create greater impact for our customers. Through these innovations, we are able to fulfill our purpose of advancing business and communities through the power of data science," said Sabin M. Aboitiz, Aboitiz Group President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
TSI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aboitiz power business unit Aboitiz Power Corporation, is the project company of the 300-MW baseload power plant in Toril, Davao City and Sta. Cruz, Davao del Sur.
TSI uses data science, specifically an automated "control loop system," to feed regulated amounts of limestone to its furnace in order to help significantly reduce sulfur oxide emissions.
For TSI, adding the precise amount of limestone to the combustion process is essential. Too little limestone and the power plant's emissions spike; too much limestone and the power plant's waste ash chemically changes into hazardous waste. Data science plays a crucial role in determining the right amount of limestone usage for optimum results.
As a result, TSI has operated sustainably over the years, supplying reliable baseload power to over 20 electric cooperatives and distribution utilities all over Mindanao - proof that baseload power plants can operate efficiently and responsibly.
From 2017 to 2019, TSI's greenhouse gas emissions shrunk by an estimated 27%, thanks in part to the controlled and automated addition of limestone.
"With digital transformation being a key driver of AboitizPower's growth strategy in the next decade, we will continue to leverage data science to ensure sustainable operations for the ultimate benefit of the customers and communities we serve," said Emmanuel V. Rubio, AboitizPower President and CEO.
Republic Cement's AI tool
Limestone is also one of the many resources that are efficiently utilized by Aboitiz infrastructure business unit Republic Cement.
Republic Cement has teamed up with Aboitiz banking and financial services unit UnionBank to create an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that predicts cement quality based on historical chemical concentration combinations.
With this data, Republic Cement is able to optimize concentrations of raw materials, including limestone, resulting in better resource management and increased operational efficiency.
This is especially important for Republic Cement's main product: Portland cement, a complex product obtained from unprocessed natural limestone and clay. The Philippine government and cement industry have set minimum standards for cement quality due to the product's sensitivity to minimal changes in chemical concentrations.
"Thanks to this, we are hitting two birds with one stone: we are getting more consistent cement while trending closer to the limit (minimum standards for cement quality) and thereby being more efficient with our raw material usage. This case of data science is a perfect example of synergies between the different subsidiaries of the Aboitiz group," said Nabil Francis, Republic Cement President and CEO.
For Republic Cement, the precision that data science offers not only provides data-driven insights for internal use but also allows the company to remain steadfast in delivering consistent and high-quality products for the Philippine market and economy.
"Data Science is a key differentiator in deriving value from digital transformation. AboitizPower and Republic Cement provide two demonstrable examples of Data Science empowering an organization to achieve business value while meeting measurable environmental and sustainability goals," said Dr. David R. Hardoon, UnionBank Senior Advisor for Data and AI and Aboitiz Group Data Committee Chairman.
A strong advocate of innovation, the Aboitiz Group believes that DSAI will become a permanent aspect of the business landscape of each of the conglomerate's strategic business units, to develop and support its business models and decision-making capabilities.

Bengaluru, March 29 -- Job opportunities and salaries in data science have boomed in India, as the pandemic-driven digital transformation boosts demand for high-end skills.
Data science professionals with 3-10 years of experience get annual salaries in the Rs.25-65 lakh range, while those with more experience can command pay packages upwards of Rs.1 crore, according to recruitment firm Michael Page's 2021 India Talent Trends report. Experts with more than 15 years of experience can get paid up to Rs.1.8 crore, it said.
Companies are hiring data science professionals to help capture various types of data and derive meaningful insights from them. This can often be a complex process; hence, employers are willing to offer high salaries to data scientists and data engineers.
"The demand for data science professionals is at an all-time high, and the supply hasn't been able to catch up, leading to an acute shortage of talent. Firms are willing to pay a premium, along with other benefits and long-term incentives, in order to attract and retain employees-leading to an increase in the overall compensation levels," said Karan Madhok, associate director, Michael Page India.
The main difference between data engineers and data scientists is one of focus. While data engineers are involved in building the infrastructure and architecture for data generation, data scientists are mainly concerned with performing advanced mathematics and statistical analysis on the collected data.
"Rapid growth and demand in digital transformation and advanced analytics have led to a surge in demand for data science professionals in key technology areas such as artificial intelligence, analytics, internet of things, blockchain and quantum computing," said Saran Balasundaram, founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Han Digital, a talent consulting company.
"As more and more companies move to the cloud, the need for data science and engineering talent will further increase."
The shortage of skills in data science is evident from how long it takes to find such professionals.
"The time taken to hire engineers in general is six-to-eight weeks, while the time to hire data scientists is 11-12 weeks. Also, the starting salary for data science professionals is 15-20% higher than other roles in engineering," said Anshuman Das, cofounder and CEO of talent acquisition company CareerNet.
Data science professionals also command better salary hikes both internally and during job changes.
"When changing jobs, generally people demand 25-30% hike, but data scientists demand a 35-45% hike. The average annual pay hike for them falls between 20-30% compared with 15-20% for the rest of the employees," Das added.

"With the Data and Society team, nonprofits will have access to technical experts committed to the use of technology for social good," said Juech. "We are prepared to meet nonprofits where they are in each of their data journeys and work alongside them to develop data maturity. We are eager to create and share a portfolio of use cases to provide practical examples of what's possible in the field of data and AI for social change, guided by equity and the ethical use of data."
The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. The definitive merger agreements were advised by Venable LLP for the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation and by Adler & Colvin LLC for the Cloudera Foundation.
The Patrick J. McGovern Foundationis a global philanthropy bridging the frontiers of artificial intelligence, data science, and social impact to create a thriving, equitable, and sustainable future for all. With more than 130 grants around the globe, the Foundation's work spansclimate change, digital health,social justice and pandemic response,tech education and workforce development, and data and AI ethics.

Cloudera Foundation merger strengthens data science and AI support for nonprofits

Mar 30, 2021( VentureBeat: http://venturebeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  From TikTok to Instagram, how's your creative working for you?  In digital marketing, there's no one-size-fits-all. Learn how data can make or break the performance of creative across all platforms. 
 Register Now[1]  Join Transform 2021 for the most important themes in enterprise AI &#38; Data. Learn more[2]. Today, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation and the Cloudera Foundation, software company Cloudera's philanthropic arm, announced a merger that will launch an initiative to accelerate data and AI maturity within nonprofits. In a definitive agreement, Silicon Valley-based Cloudera Foundation will merge its staff, $9 million endowment, and $3 million in grants with the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, a $1.5 billion data science and AI philanthropic organization. The companies say the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval. Nonprofits face significant barriers to leveraging big data analytics and AI tools for driving strategy, growth, and global impact. The gaps in knowledge and technical expertise translate to opportunity costs in efficiency, impact, and scalability. A 2019 survey[3] by PwrdBy found that nonprofit-specific AI is reaching fewer than 23% of organizations worldwide. In that same report, 83% of respondents said they believe ethical frameworks need to be defined before the nonprofit sector sees 'full adoption' of AI. 'Data science and AI-based tools, deployed with purpose and social conscience, could improve nearly every part of the human experience. Enabling civil society to access these technologies will unlock transformational approaches to many of the world's greatest challenges,' Patrick J. McGovern Foundation president Vilas Dhar said in a press release. 'Backed by philanthropic capital and deep technical expertise, we are working together with social changemakers to advance a tech-enabled, human-centered future.' The Cloudera Foundation, which was founded in 2017 with the mission of providing technology and mentorship to foster data expertise in the civil sector, has piloted its approach with seven nonprofits. The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation plans to broaden the foundation's efforts post-merger to up to 100 organizations addressing the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, the collection of 2030 goals[4] set by the UN General Assembly as 'a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.' Cloudera Foundation CEO Claudia Juech will direct activities around data enablement for nonprofits as VP of Data and Society at the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, a new program. Data and Society will offer a range of services, including public workshops, multi-year data science development collaborations, and accelerator partnerships focusing on extracting actionable insights from datasets. For example, Data and Society could help organizations combating climate change better manage their resources. In a report[5] on the civil sector's adoption of AI, the Brookings Institute cites a partnership between The Nature Conservancy and the Red Cross to create a dashboard incorporating social media data on floods for city planning — an effort that might assist cities in becoming more sustainable. 'AI can enable nonprofits to manage a broad range of activities. In conjunction with machine learning and data analytics, it is a way to control costs, handle internal operations, and automate routine tasks within the organization,' the report's coauthors wrote[6]. 'Adoption of these tools can help groups with limited resources streamline internal operations and external communications and thereby improve the manner in which they function.' Cloudera cofounder and Cloudera Foundation chair Mike Olson added: 'Our missions couldn't be better matched. We have seen how data and analytics enable nonprofits to work more effectively and increase their impact. With the leadership and resources of the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, our team can do even more to help mission-driven organizations change the world.'

As society becomes more digitalised, institutions need more and more data science skills. This includes the integration of tools arising from artificial intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to society as a whole. To this end, as a pioneer within the federal administration, the FSO is teaming up with the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC), a joint venture between the two federal institutes of technology.

'I am extremely enthusiastic about this strategic partnership in a joint flagship project between our two institutes and the FSO', said Martin Vetterli, EPFL President. 'It reminds me of the partnership between the Alan Turing Institute in London and the British Office for National Statistics, committed to a joint vision of research and innovation in regard to data science.'

Three strands of cooperation

The first strand of cooperation is to strengthen the FSO's Data Science Competence Center (DSCC), of which the SDSC will become a strategic partner. The EPFL and the ETH Zurich will support the FSO in identifying the necessary profiles and in recruiting the specialists that will form the DSCC. The two institutes also undertake to receive these associates 'in residence' at the SDSC laboratories with a view to developing their skills and helping with networking in this field in Switzerland. Lastly, the partners will together identify the DSCC's priority projects and cooperate in their execution.

The second strand concerns cooperation in regard to infrastructure. The open-source technological platform RENKU, developed by the SDSC will be used by the DSCC. On the academic network SWITCH, RENKU enables the practice of data science and artificial intelligence in a collaborative and reproducible way, criteria essential to the FSO. A dedicated instance was specifically created for the FSO so that the principles of data protection provided for in law can be systematically applied. At no time do the data leave the Swiss national territory

The third strand aims to promote understanding and the sharing of data science and artificial intelligence knowledge and practices within the federal administration.

Digitalisation and public administration

'With this partnership, the FSO is enabling itself to fulfil the fundamental mission assigned to it by the Federal Council in May 2020. Following the launch of its DSCC on 1 January 2021, it will also be able to meet the challenges brought about by the profound changes in the data ecosystem and by the increased use of algorithms in the public sector', enthused Georges-Simon Ulrich, Director General of the FSO.

In concrete terms, the DSCC will function as a service provider in the field of data science for the whole of the federal administration. It seeks and encourages cooperation with other levels of government (cantons and communes). The DSCC's mission is to work at the crossroads between data science and artificial intelligence. Its mission is to build skills allowing the use of methods, techniques and practices arising from data science and artificial intelligence to obtain a new understanding of fields related to public policy and thus to help with decision-making for the public good, in accordance with ethical principles.

The President of the ETH Zurich, Joel Mesot, pointed out the relevance of this partnership. 'Putting data science and artificial intelligence at the service of the public good is one of today's major challenges. The Federal Institutes of Technology are proud to be able to bring their skills into this field and to support the Confederation in this transition so that it will benefit all sectors of society.'

About the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC)

In 2017, the ETH Board launched a national initiative in regard to data science that resulted in the creation of a unique joint venture between the EPFL and the ETH Zurich: the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC), aimed at promoting innovation in data science, multi-disciplinary research and open science. The SDSC's mission is to accelerate the use of data science and machine learning techniques within academic disciplines and industry.

Washington: US Navy has issued the following news release:
Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) presented the expansion of its data science training program at the virtual Naval Applications of Machine Learning workshop, March 23-25, providing the workforce with skills in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence to accelerate digital transformation across the organization.
Digital transformation is the adoption of digital technologies at speed and scale to transform services or businesses through replacing manual processes with digital processes or replacing old digital systems with new digital systems.
In 2019, NAVWAR introduced a two-part data science workshop where experts in the field trained members of the workforce in the basic concepts of data science. Since 2019, the workshop has grown to include a comprehensive five-course data science-training program. More than 500 NAVWAR employees, from a variety of professional backgrounds, have completed courses within the program.
“Advances in digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning have expanded the modern battlefield,” said NAVWAR Executive Director John Pope. “These technologies coupled with process improvement and an innovative mindset of continual learning, are critical to winning the future fight. This data science program empowers professionals from across our organization to apply these advanced technologies in new and creative ways to rapidly make data-driven decisions for the fleet. ”
Program training courses include a three-part progression of a data science fundamentals class, a hands-on data science laboratory, and a theory-to-practice incubator course for those who want to apply their training to real-world projects and problem sets.
The data science fundamentals course is a two-day workshop, available to all NAVWAR employees interested in an in-depth introduction to data science, including machine learning and artificial intelligence. The laboratory provides case study-based training that takes participants through the full lifecycle of an analytics project, from problem definition through the presentation of findings. The incubator then pairs participants with data scientists and subject matter experts to apply advanced analytics techniques to address business challenges.
Cheryl Livingston, from NAVWAR’s Contracts Department, recently completed an incubator project within the data science training program. While participating in the fundamentals workshop, Livingston spotted an opportunity to apply data science techniques to a quarterly requirement to forecast contracts two fiscal years into the future. Working with experts in the field, Livingston was able to explore various approaches to improve the accuracy of time-series forecasts, from linear-regression to machine learning software, where ultimately, an ensemble modeling approach led to the most accurate forecasting solution.
NAVWAR also launched a foundations for data citizens course and foundations of data analytics course. Mandatory for all employees, foundations for data citizens promote the appropriate and responsible use of data and technology to perform work, collaborate with others, and address new challenges. Required for all supervisor-level professionals, foundations of data analytics ensures supervisors and those performing data analysis are armed with the analytical skills needed to improve decision-making and drive successful operations in a data-driven organization.
“With support from NAVWAR leadership, what started as a pilot effort to deliver training on data science to the workforce has grown into a program that I believe is truly unique in the Navy,” said David Byres, Logistics and Fleet Support program manager for the data science training initiative. “The emphasis on applying these techniques to our common business problems goes further than what has been attempted thus far, in delivering training on a critical, but also challenging, topic. ”
In addition to these five courses, NAVWAR is working to develop a sixth course titled foundations of data visualization. The course will train participants on how to curate a visual summary of their data to better communicate the significance and meaning of the information provided.
“We are continuing to evolve our decision-making culture and a big component of this effort is training and practical application,” said Mary-Kate Bailey, NAVWAR director of Organizational Development and Training. “Our digital training learning continuum provides both; foundational data science training as well fosters a supportive ecosystem for collaboration among our digital experts. It is essentially a building block approach to the training and we continually re-evaluate the curriculum to ensure we integrate new areas of specialization. The new data visualization class is a case in point. ”
NAVWAR’s data science team is also participating in this year’s Hack the Machine event, March 23-26, leading the design of the data science challenge centered on the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging competitors to push traditional boundaries and explore unconventional solutions for future decision-making nationwide.

What we just learned about data science - and what's next

2020 could be called The Year Data Science Grew Up. Organizations of all kinds significantly ramped up their adoption of data-oriented applications and turned to data science to solve their problems-with varying degrees of success. In the process, data science was increasingly called upon to show its maturity and prove its real value, demonstrating that it actually worked in production.
The emergence of a deadly global pandemic threw a wrench into designs-not all of them good-that had grown over the course of years in ways that have become difficult to maintain, adjust, or improve upon today. COVID-19 required the rapid analysis and sharing of massive amounts of data. Predictive models were run and updated with a new urgency amid constantly changing conditions-with all the world judging their accuracy and integrity.
[ How data analysis, AI, and IoT will shape the post-pandemic 'new normal' ]
The past 12 months have revealed how valuable data science can be while also exposing its limitations. In 2020, there were numerous challenges to data science's credibility, adaptability, and ultimate usefulness that will need to be addressed in 2021.
Let's look at the key levers.
Data science in 2020
This proliferation of data science, while exciting, falsely suggested that the field is now somehow settled. On the contrary, data science remains very much a "new" field, innovating at a rapid clip.
If one followed the hype cycle, data science appeared to go mainstream in 2020, with vendors across the landscape co-opting AI. Every product or service seemed to have artificial intelligence somehow attached, no matter how loosely. As such, expectations rose to impossible heights, with companies expecting smart data solutions to solve all of their problems. Data science just doesn't work that way.
Fortunately, people now are moving beyond the hype and asking the right questions in order to understand what data science can and can't accomplish. Thus data science is now receiving attention based on its quality and the return on investment that is possible when constructed the right way.
Adaptability challenges
One of the fundamental challenges of data science has always been finding a way to repeatedly and reliably take a model from creation and put it into production. This can significantly hinder realization of ROI-which was certainly the case after the onslaught of COVID-19. Consider all the behaviors that changed throughout the pandemic. Machine learning models built prior to COVID-19, at minimum, needed to undergo at least an update, if not an entire redesign and retraining, to account for these changes.
Depending on the problem domain and what the models were asked to solve for, the new reality might look radically different from the pre-COVID world, so much so that the millions of data points relied upon for insights break down because old base assumptions no longer hold. Models needed to be updated to incorporate new data and adjust to the new reality, and the entire process from data science creation to production had to be revisited.
Because this has traditionally been quite difficult to do and because companies were suddenly forced to revise models quite rapidly, the rigor and frequency with which models were tested slipped. Models were instead being created in a rush without verification. This harmed the credibility of data science to some extent.
[ Also on InfoWorld: How to choose a data analytics platform ]
2020 highlighted the gap between the creation of sound, tested data science models and the deployment of production-ready models that can subsequently be modified as needed without recreating the wheel. Fortunately, we are beginning to see new approaches that eliminate this gap as the year winds down.
Bias in AI models
Another issue that struck at the heart of the credibility and usefulness of data science was that of bias. Social justice moved to the forefront in 2020. The natural reaction was to try to eliminate bias wherever possible. And because every company became an AI company, there was a push to remove bias from AI models-a task that is inherently problematic.
Often when we remove bias from data science models, when we make them "non-discriminatory," we weaken the results and ultimately the value of the models. There also exists the danger that when one component is removed from a data science model, something else creeps in, with the result that bias is not eliminated altogether but just replaced by a different kind of bias.
Mitigating AI model bias is an important issue, as data science is increasingly relied upon to help drive decisions, and we don't want those decisions to be prejudiced or unfair. How can we create and deploy data science in an ethical way? A model must be understandable, provable, and verifiable. This is undoubtedly an area that will be explored in greater depth in the months and years to come.
Data science in 2021 and beyond
Significant strides were made in the past year to surface the issues holding back data science. As the hype cycle surrounding data science now ends, the field can become more serious and focused on innovation and problem solving.
Production breakthroughs
Perhaps the most exciting opportunity for data science is the momentum behind an integrated deployment approach. With widespread availability of technology to close the gap between creation and production, data scientists will no longer have to translate between several different technologies. This will be game changing, saving time and frustration while yielding more accurate outcomes.
As it becomes much easier and faster to move models from testing to production, data science will deliver a far greater return on its investment to multiple stakeholders-not just data scientists. Organizations will benefit by enabling different groups to consume and understand data insights.
[ Also on InfoWorld: A brief history of artificial intelligence ]2nd generation collaboration
Expect to see different groups get involved with the creation and development of data science moving forward. Business analysts and engineers need to work with data scientists, all collaborating together to get it right. Each group brings a different perspective to the table, which makes data science more insightful, impactful, and useful for business purposes.
The advanced collaboration required specifically for data science will take the form of combining collaboration models at various levels to meet different needs. By sharing components, organizations will be able to wrap up a certain piece of expertise, data blending, machine optimization, or even a reporting module and share it across the organization. Such functional and purposeful collaboration combined with the appropriate amount of automation will characterize the next phase of data science.
Flexible environments
One consequence of COVID-19 has been an acceleration of digital transformation initiatives, and cloud and hybrid environments have become much more prevalent. This trend will continue throughout 2021.
Organizations are not locking into one cloud, or even just moving all of their data into the cloud. Many on-premises environments remain, and companies will want to include their data center infrastructure in the mix without purchasing huge computational resources that will only be used every so often.
Instead, they will look for elasticity and the ability to scale hybrid environments up and down to meet the resource requirements of specific workloads. As such, it is essential that data science can be conducted in a variety of environments and shared across the data center and cloud in order to maximize effectiveness. Outstanding options are emerging to enable data science adoption to expand in new ways.
Closing thoughts
Data science maturity is all over the map today. The space between the organizations that are just getting on board and those that have been in the trenches for a while may narrow some in 2021, but the gulf will persist for a good while longer.
The reason? The organizations that have implemented data science successfully and that understand its capabilities and limitations will continue to experiment using open source technologies to try something out. If it works, they can make it available for broader use. They will feel free to play and push the envelope without draining IT budgets on a hunch, and this is where the greatest innovation will happen.
[ Participate in InfoWorld's 2021 Data & Analytics survey to share your thoughts and expertise on data-driven investments, strategies, and challenges ]
At the same time, data science will become more accessible. Low-code capabilities are beginning to reach more users across the enterprise, facilitating greater opportunities. With more people understanding data science and using it to solve problems faster than ever before, the benefits of data science will be democratized and new possibilities will be unlocked.
Data science came a long way in 2020, despite hitting some bumps with the pandemic. Because we're being forced to confront key data science challenges, very exciting advances are occurring. 2021 will be the year data science gets real and shows its return on investment in deep and meaningful ways.

(TNSRes) -- ETH Zurich issued the following news release on March 25, 2021:
The Federal Statistical Office (FSO) is joining forces with the Swiss Data Science Center, a joint venture between the two federal institutes of technology, to encourage the use of data science and artificial intelligence within the administration.
As society becomes more digitalised, institutions need more and more data science skills. This includes the integration of tools arising from artificial intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to society as a whole. To this end, as a pioneer within the federal administration, the FSO is teaming up with the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC), a joint venture between the two federal institutes of technology.
"I am extremely enthusiastic about this strategic partnership in a joint flagship project between our two institutes and the FSO", said Martin Vetterli, President of the EPFL. "It reminds me of the partnership between the Alan Turing Institute in London and the British Office for National Statistics, committed to a joint vision of research and innovation in regard to data science."
Three strands of cooperation
The first strand of cooperation is to strengthen the FSO's Data Science Competence Center (DSCC), of which the SDSC will become a strategic partner. The EPFL and the ETH Zurich will support the FSO in identifying the necessary profiles and in recruiting the specialists that will form the DSCC. The two institutes also undertake to receive these associates 'in residence' at the SDSC laboratories with a view to developing their skills and helping with networking in this field in Switzerland. Lastly, the partners will together identify the DSCC's priority projects and cooperate in their execution.
The second strand concerns cooperation in regard to infrastructure. The open-source technological platform RENKU, developed by the SDSC will be used by the DSCC. On the academic network SWITCH, RENKU enables the practice of data science and artificial intelligence in a collaborative and reproducible way, criteria essential to the FSO. A dedicated instance was specifically created for the FSO so that the principles of data protection provided for in law can be systematically applied. At no time do the data leave the Swiss national territory.
The third strand aims to promote understanding and the sharing of data science and artificial intelligence knowledge and practices within the federal administration.
Digitalisation and public administration
"With this partnership, the FSO is enabling itself to fulfil the fundamental mission assigned to it by the Federal Council in May 2020. Following the launch of its DSCC on 1 January 2021, it will also be able to meet the challenges brought about by the profound changes in the data ecosystem and by the increased use of algorithms in the public sector", enthused Georges-Simon Ulrich, Director General of the FSO.
In concrete terms, the DSCC will function as a service provider in the field of data science for the whole of the federal administration. It seeks and encourages cooperation with other levels of government (cantons and communes). The DSCC's mission is to work at the crossroads between data science and artificial intelligence. Its mission is to build skills allowing the use of methods, techniques and practices arising from data science and artificial intelligence to obtain a new understanding of fields related to public policy and thus to help with decision-making for the public good, in accordance with ethical principles.
The President of the ETH Zurich, Joel Mesot, pointed out the relevance of this partnership. "Putting data science and artificial intelligence at the service of the public good is one of today's major challenges. The Federal Institutes of Technology are proud to be able to bring their skills into this field and to support the Confederation in this transition so that it will benefit all sectors of society."
About the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC)
In 2017, the ETH Board launched a national initiative in regard to data science that resulted in the creation of a unique joint venture between the EPFL and the ETH Zurich: the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC), aimed at promoting innovation in data science, multi-disciplinary research and open science. The SDSC's mission is to accelerate the use of data science and machine learning techniques within academic disciplines and industry.

Tableau has introduced Business Science, a new class of AI-powered analytics that lowers the barrier to data science techniques, enabling business users and analysts to make smarter decisions faster. In a market where agility is the ultimate competitive advantage, Business Science empowers more people with data, with simplified model creation, predictions, what-if scenarios, forecasting and other analytical methods - all using clicks, not code.
Tableau will deliver Einstein Discovery in its 2021.1 update later this month, the first major release enabling Business Science. Integrating Einstein Discovery's trusted, real-time predictions and recommendations into Tableau will help people go beyond understanding what happened and why it happened, to explore likely business outcomes and inform proactive action. For more than five years, Einstein Discovery has helped Salesforce customers surface insights and understand patterns across millions of rows of data in minutes, without requiring sophisticated data models.
"Today, data science is out of reach for most business users. Business analysts have relied on data scientists to extract powerful, precise insights using sophisticated models. But getting to those insights can be complex, expensive and time consuming," said Chandana Gopal, research director, future of intelligence, IDC. "While data science can unlock powerful insights, there is sometimes a trade-off between precision and time-to-insight. Business Science recognizes that trade-off and seeks to make data science accessible and actionable for more people."
Business Science will elevate the work of both data scientists and advanced analysts.
"Data science has always been able to solve big problems but too often that power is limited to a few select people within an organization," said Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer, Tableau. "To build truly data-driven organizations, we need to unlock the power of data for as many people as possible. Democratizing data science will help more people make smarter decisions faster."
Customers can use Business Science to improve supply chain efficiency, predict likelihood of purchase or maximize delivery of goods or services, for example. Data science could help with vaccine research and development, while Business Science could help with distribution and get shots in people's arms.
"Machine Learning platforms like Einstein Discovery are the next frontier in democratizing data science," said Siddharth Dayama, senior manager of data analytics, Verizon. "Einstein Discovery integrated into Tableau brings predictive capabilities to the existing inventory of dashboards companies already have, and when that's combined with auto-generated machine learning models, businesses can explore patterns, trends and correlations in their historical data without writing a single line of code. Layering ML/AI capabilities on existing BI infrastructure opens up a world of possibilities in day-to-day business problem solving."

EDWARDSVILLE, Ill., March 25 -- Southern Illinois University- Edwardsville issued the following news release:
Real-world applications are essential to college student development, specifically for those pursuing data sciences. Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's Center for Predictive Analytics' (C-PAN) Data Science Internship (DSI) Program is providing students with the opportunity to gain applied experience in data analysis to prepare for their future careers while aiding the local region with affordable and novel data solutions.
C-PAN was founded in 2019 to support the growing need for big data and machine learning solutions on the SIUE campus and surrounding area. By assisting campus researchers and local industries, C-PAN provides innovative data analysis solutions and real-world training opportunities to the next generation of data scientists.
C-PAN is currently recruiting graduate and undergraduate student interns to provide data analysis skills for a variety of projects. Student interns at the undergraduate level gain exposure to real-world datasets while receiving hands-on training they can utilize in their future careers. Graduate student interns work on data science projects while serving as project managers and coordinating teams of undergraduate students.
"What we are finding with training students in data science is that coursework is invaluable and has its rightful place, but students also need hands-on training in order to develop the data skills they'll need in the workplace," said C-PAN Director Carolyn Butts-Wilmsmeyer, PhD. "The DSI Program will help students develop those important job skills before they graduate."
Within the DSI Program, interns can expect to conduct data analysis, compile data, help researchers find and evaluate data analysis tools, help others understand their analysis, and troubleshoot coding errors in R, SAS, Python, Excel, and Business Intelligence software.
Geography major Courtney Flach, of Montrose, is C-PAN's inaugural DSI graduate student. Flach applies her background in math, computer science, and geography to solve complex data problems while mentoring undergraduate students.
"Through C-PAN, I have had the opportunity to work with several different types of data, been exposed to different methods, and gained experience interpreting data and reporting it in a way that others can understand," said Flach. "These are valuable skills in preparing for a future career that I would have not otherwise gained."
Flach has contributed to numerous C-PAN projects, including leading "An Analysis of Housing in St. Louis by Race, Income, and Parcel Vacancy Rates." She is currently managing C-PAN's Data Science Help Desk while working on risk assessment, weather, and geospatial models.
"Since the program's establishment, many students have become involved, which is wonderful to see," added Flach. "Each student plays an integral role that is geared towards their interests. The housing project involved geospatial analysis, which is directly in line with the type of work I want to pursue. Having the opportunity to build on my skills in this field is extremely beneficial."
Flach aspires to work in the geography field, preferably GIS or weather-related, where she can continue to work with and mine data.
"As every discipline becomes progressively more data-driven in this digital world, a lot of brilliant researchers are finding themselves in a position where they have collected an amazing dataset but need to use statistical and data science resources in order to analyze their data," added Butts-Wilmsmeyer. "The DSI Program helps to provide a resource to researchers both on campus and at nearby industries, while providing interns the chance to gain data science and statistical analysis experience under the guidance of a faculty member."
Students interested in C-PAN's DSI program can contact Butts-Wilmsmeyer at cbuttsw@siue.edu or 618-650-2682. To meet C-PAN's current DSI students, visit siue.edu/cpan/about/who-we-are.

SCHOOL OF DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS, INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP A CORNERSTONE TO INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS

KENNESAW, Ga., March 26 -- Kennesaw State University issued the following news release:
KENNESAW, Ga.
(Mar 26, 2021) - Before finishing his degree at Kennesaw State, Trevor Sands never thought his analytical
skills would make him a fit at one of the world's largest flooring manufacturers.
However, he quickly learned that not only were his skills needed in the flooring industry,
but they were also needed in virtually any industry. Following a research presentation
at KSU's annual R-Day, he was aggressively recruited by Georgia-based Shaw Industries
for an internship opportunity and was hired full time before graduating from KSU.
"I often joke that this was the job I didn't want because I thought it would be boring,
but I couldn't have been more wrong," said Sands, now a data scientist at Shaw Industries.
"Once I began working with the company and seeing how I could be utilized, I started
to realize exactly how much opportunity I have to grow in my career at Shaw and why
data scientists are so sought after. We can suit every industry."
Like Sands, more than 4,200 students in KSU's School of Data Science and Analytics are applying their skills to help industry partners solve their most pressing problems.
The students, in return, gain exposure to a variety of potential career pathways.
Officially launched in January, the School is unique in that it is composed of students
across a variety of degree programs, including the country's first Ph.D. in Analytics and Data Science, a master's degree and a minor in applied statistics and data analysis.
"We have taken a very interdisciplinary orientation with regard to data science,"
said Jennifer Priestley, director of the Ph.D. program. "Our students are taught this
as its own discipline; they are truly exploring the science of data. So at its core,
you will find that it is similar across all industries, and I think that has been
a factor in why we've been so successful in partnering with so many companies across
the region."
Through the Center for Statistics and Analytical Research (CSAR), the School of Data Science and Analytics has received more than $3 million
in research funding across partnerships with 20 different organizations representing
government, financial technology, manufacturing and healthcare industries. It's also
home to various labs sponsored by industry leaders such as Equifax, Home Depot and
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, which have generated three patents and hundreds
of peer-reviewed research publications and proceedings. The School also houses the
Human Studies Lab, funded by the Gerber Foundation and Wellstar, and the Diplomacy
Lab, a university-wide partnership supporting the U.S. State Department.
Generally speaking, companies partner with the School for several reasons, including
building a talent pipeline, said Priestley, who recently co-authored a book titled
Closing the Analytics Talent Gap: The Analytics Professional's Guide to Working with
Universities. As was the case with Sands, this often takes the form of an internship but also
happens when industry partners sponsor capstone and research projects.
The second reason companies partner with universities is that it allows companies
to temporarily extend their resources to tackle short-term projects. Sometimes, this
takes place in the Applied Analytics Course, with student teams solving real-world
problems under the guidance of a corporate sponsor. Over the years, sponsors of the
course have included Georgia Pacific, SPANX, Cox Communications, Shaw Industries,
Equifax, and Coke One North America.
The third reason is that companies are seeking research collaboration, which complements
the Ph.D. research environment cultivated within the School. Bill Franks, director
of CSAR, said that while many leading companies have their own research and development
departments, Kennesaw State has the ability to augment their research by connecting
them with faculty experts and students eager to gain experience.
"By working with us, they have access to resources who have relevant expertise and
can dedicate their time to getting the research done and tested, while the sponsor
can focus on their business operations," he said. "In that sense, we help accelerate
the discovery process."
The final reason to partner with a university is tied to altruism, Priestley said.
Organizations are looking to positively impact their communities and turn to the data
scientists at KSU for help. Previously, faculty and students have helped chart COVID-19
vaccine distributions, helped a local fire department improve call response time and
even crunched numbers to help develop an optimal travel route for the Bert's Big Adventure
charity fundraiser with Jersey Mike's Subs.
"Our default position with every organization that reaches out to us is, 'Yes, we
will work with you.we have a way to help you,'" she said. "We never turn anyone away.
If we don't have the expertise in our School then we are certain that someone within
the greater university does. This is foundational to being in a community."

   - Tableau 2021.1 delivers AI-generated predictions, insights and automated explanations to help democratize data science
   Tableau, the world's leading analytics platform (NYSE: CRM), today introduced Business Science, a new class of AI-powered analytics that lowers the barrier to data science techniques, enabling business users and analysts to make smarter decisions faster. In a market where agility is the ultimate competitive advantage, Business Science empowers more people with data, with simplified model creation, predictions, what-if scenarios, forecasting and other analytical methods - all using clicks, not code.
   Video - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1471698/Business_Science_Explainer.mp4 Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1471693/LikelyPayment.jpg Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/411941/TABLEAU_SOFTWARE_LOGOjpg_Logo.jpg
   Tableau will deliver Einstein Discovery in its 2021.1 update later this month, the first major release enabling Business Science. Integrating Einstein Discovery's trusted, real-time predictions and recommendations into Tableau will help people go beyond understanding what happened and why it happened, to explore likely business outcomes and inform proactive action. For more than five years, Einstein Discovery has helped Salesforce customers surface insights and understand patterns across millions of rows of data in minutes, without requiring sophisticated data models.
   "Today, data science is out of reach for most business users. Business analysts have relied on data scientists to extract powerful, precise insights using sophisticated models. But getting to those insights can be complex, expensive and time consuming," said Chandana Gopal, research director, future of intelligence, IDC. "While data science can unlock powerful insights, there is sometimes a trade-off between precision and time-to-insight. Business Science recognizes that trade-off and seeks to make data science accessible and actionable for more people."
   Business Science will elevate the work of both data scientists and advanced analysts.
   "Data science has always been able to solve big problems but too often that power is limited to a few select people within an organization," said Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer, Tableau. "To build truly data-driven organizations, we need to unlock the power of data for as many people as possible. Democratizing data science will help more people make smarter decisions faster."
   Customers can use Business Science to improve supply chain efficiency, predict likelihood of purchase or maximize delivery of goods or services, for example. Data science could help with vaccine research and development, while Business Science could help with distribution and get shots in people's arms.
   "Machine Learning platforms like Einstein Discovery are the next frontier in democratizing data science," said Siddharth Dayama, senior manager of data analytics, Verizon. "Einstein Discovery integrated into Tableau brings predictive capabilities to the existing inventory of dashboards companies already have, and when that's combined with auto-generated machine learning models, businesses can explore patterns, trends and correlations in their historical data without writing a single line of code. Layering ML/AI capabilities on existing BI infrastructure opens up a world of possibilities in day-to-day business problem solving."
   Additional capabilities available in 2021.1 include:
   - New Microsoft Azure Connectivity Improvements allow people to connect to their data in Azure SQL Database (with Azure Active Directory) and Azure Data Lake Gen 2. Tableau also now supports Azure Active Directory in two existing connectors, Azure Synapse and Azure Databricks. - A new Extension Gallery helps people easily search for and discover connectors and dashboard extensions within Tableau. From the gallery, customers can easily discover and install connectors and dashboard extensions that add functionality to their dashboards and connectors that enable Tableau to access additional databases and applications, within their Tableau workflow. - A redesigned notification experience displays a Tableau user's shares, comments, extracts and prep flows together in one dedicated space. This communicates all important changes across the organization. People can choose where to receive these notifications -- directly in Tableau, email or both -- ensuring they're aware of important alerts or updates. - Quicker, easier Level of Detail (LOD) expressions let people use context menus or drag-and-drop a measure onto a dimension to automatically create a Level of Detail expression with the default aggregation. - A new Salesforce Customer 360 Audiences Connector natively connects Tableau to Customer 360 Audiences, uncovering insights in detailed customer data. With the new connector, Tableau customers can explore by campaign, channel and multiple customer dimensions to understand the 'who' and 'why' behind their cross-channel engagement results.

San Francisco, California: Salesforce.com, inc has issued the following press release:
Tableau, the world’s leading analytics platform (NYSE: CRM), today introduced Business Science, a new class of AI-powered analytics that lowers the barrier to data science techniques, enabling business users and analysts to make smarter decisions faster. In a market where agility is the ultimate competitive advantage, Business Science empowers more people with data, with simplified model creation, predictions, what-if scenarios, forecasting and other analytical methods –all using clicks, not code.
Tableau will deliver Einstein Discovery in its 2021.1 update, the first major release enabling Business Science. Integrating Einstein Discovery’s trusted, real-time predictions and recommendations into Tableau will help people go beyond understanding what happened and why it happened, to explore likely business outcomes and inform proactive action. For more than five years, Einstein Discovery has helped Salesforce customers surface insights and understand patterns across millions of rows of data in minutes, without requiring sophisticated data models.
“Today, data science is out of reach for most business users. Business analysts have relied on data scientists to extract powerful, precise insights using sophisticated models. But getting to those insights can be complex, expensive and time consuming,” said Chandana Gopal, research director, future of intelligence, IDC. “While data science can unlock powerful insights, there is sometimes a trade-off between precision and time-to-insight. Business Science recognizes that trade-off and seeks to make data science accessible and actionable for more people. ”
Business Science will elevate the work of both data scientists and advanced analysts.
“Data science has always been able to solve big problems but too often that power is limited to a few select people within an organization,” said Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer, Tableau. “To build truly data-driven organizations, we need to unlock the power of data for as many people as possible. Democratizing data science will help more people make smarter decisions faster. ”

The problem with data science education; The current field seems to be producing jacks of all trades rather than practical experts who can hit the ground running.

Body




 THE demand for data science professionals has been echoed in the increased supply of data science education. In the field of data science alone, we have witnessed a flourishing of formal degrees, diplomas, and certifications, among other forms of training.
However, has our eagerness in producing data scientists resulted in the proliferation of generalists rather than practical experts in the field'
What is data science? Unfortunately, this is a complex question with a diverse answer depending on who you ask. Interestingly, it is the diversity of this answer that results in the quandary as to the skills required to be acquired by a data science professional.
According to Wikipedia, data science is, in the broad sense, "an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data".
The field is a hybrid of statistics, machine learning, and data mining, and covers programming languages, technology frameworks, development platforms, as well as visualisation tools.
In other words, data science is the umbrella under which all these individual and/or intersecting disciplines sit.
The diversification and complexity of data science poses a real academic challenge in data science education. How does one balance the multiplicity of areas, covering them with sufficient depth in order to produce a well-rounded data scientist who can provide impactful value to a future employer'
Producing effective data scientists
The article Placing 'practice' at the centre of data science education by Eric Kolaczyk, Haviland Wright, and Masanao Yajima highlighted such a challenge where existing degree programmes "can leave students, upon exiting academia, needing a non-trivial ramping-up period before they can truly have an impact with their first employers".
This feedback is common and goes beyond that of the applicability of the practicum component of a degree. The majority of data scientists, upon completion of their education, still require a hands-on education at their place of employment to refine their learned skills to practical necessities.
In other words, a freshly minted, well-rounded data scientist is unlikely to hit the ground running at their first employ despite a presumption otherwise.
How then should well-rounded data scientists be produced - so that they can be effective, as close as possible to day one, upon exiting their respective training'
Rather than trying to cover the breadth of all that is data science, academia may wish to recognise that the field has matured and evolved in its pedagogy taxonomy.
Focusing on professional application, rather than pure academic research, we can identify the following four key example roles that an organisation may need in operationalising their data science ambitions:
The data science developer (or modeller), who would be the core developer with a stronger focus on data science methodologies and techniques.The data science engineer, who would focus on data piping, data quality, and data ingestion for the purpose of data science modelling.The data science solution architect, who would have a deeper understanding of platforms and data enterprise architecture for an end-to-end operationalisation.The data science storyteller, who would have a stronger focus on data visualisation and data science communication, and possess strong business process acumen.The aforementioned roles are not just an application of data science. While having overlapping areas, each carries an in-depth focus, specific required competencies, skill sets, and practicum considerations.
These elements highlight that a unified data science programme may not do any of the respective areas justice, as analytics author Thomas Davenport suggested. Worse, an employer may hire using the generic description of data scientist without realising they may need one specific area over the others - or, indeed, require four separate hires rather than the one.
Refocusing efforts
Whether through the creation of dedicated degrees with specific focus areas, diversification of modules that allow the flexibility of commonality and a major/minor approach, or a degree that differentiates between a research and a practicum (professional) focus, it is clear that there is a need to refocus our efforts.
Data science academic programmes should tailor data science education to produce professional competency with sufficient depth that enables immediate demonstrable outcome upon completion. Such programmes need to reflect the maturity of the data science field and allow more specificity in the professional expertise they aspire to produce.
Alternatively, or perhaps concurrently, employers need to appreciate that newly minted data scientists are not quite "road-ready" and may require secondary on-the-ground training in order to contextualise and surface the benefits anticipated from data scientists.
The writer is senior adviser for data and artificial intelligence (AI) at UnionBank Philippines. He is concurrently an external adviser to Singapore's Corrupt Investigation Practices Bureau (on AI) and to the Central Provident Fund Board (on data science). He was previously the Monetary Authority of Singapore's first chief data officer.

Tableau 2021.1 delivers AI-generated predictions, insights and automated explanations to help democratize data science
Tableau, the world's leading analytics platform (NYSE: CRM), today introduced Business Science, a new class of AI-powered analytics that lowers the barrier to data science techniques, enabling business users and analysts to make smarter decisions faster. In a market where agility is the ultimate competitive advantage, Business Science empowers more people with data, with simplified model creation, predictions, what-if scenarios, forecasting and other analytical methods – all using clicks, not code.
Tableau will deliver Einstein Discovery in its 2021.1 update later this month, the first major release enabling Business Science. Integrating Einstein Discovery's trusted, real-time predictions and recommendations into Tableau will help people go beyond understanding what happened and why it happened, to explore likely business outcomes and inform proactive action. For more than five years, Einstein Discovery has helped Salesforce customers surface insights and understand patterns across millions of rows of data in minutes, without requiring sophisticated data models.
"Today, data science is out of reach for most business users. Business analysts have relied on data scientists to extract powerful, precise insights using sophisticated models. But getting to those insights can be complex, expensive and time consuming," said Chandana Gopal, research director, future of intelligence, IDC. "While data science can unlock powerful insights, there is sometimes a trade-off between precision and time-to-insight. Business Science recognizes that trade-off and seeks to make data science accessible and actionable for more people."
Business Science will elevate the work of both data scientists and advanced analysts.
"Data science has always been able to solve big problems but too often that power is limited to a few select people within an organization," said Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer, Tableau. "To build truly data-driven organizations, we need to unlock the power of data for as many people as possible. Democratizing data science will help more people make smarter decisions faster."
Customers can use Business Science to improve supply chain efficiency, predict likelihood of purchase or maximize delivery of goods or services, for example. Data science could help with vaccine research and development, while Business Science could help with distribution and get shots in people's arms.
"Machine Learning platforms like Einstein Discovery are the next frontier in democratizing data science," said Siddharth Dayama, senior manager of data analytics, Verizon. "Einstein Discovery integrated into Tableau brings predictive capabilities to the existing inventory of dashboards companies already have, and when that's combined with auto-generated machine learning models, businesses can explore patterns, trends and correlations in their historical data without writing a single line of code. Layering ML/AI capabilities on existing BI infrastructure opens up a world of possibilities in day-to-day business problem solving."
Additional capabilities available in 2021.1 include:
New Microsoft Azure Connectivity Improvements allow people to connect to their data in Azure SQL Database (with Azure Active Directory) and Azure Data Lake Gen 2. Tableau also now supports Azure Active Directory in two existing connectors, Azure Synapse and Azure Databricks. A new Extension Gallery helps people easily search for and discover connectors and dashboard extensions within Tableau. From the gallery, customers can easily discover and install connectors and dashboard extensions that add functionality to their dashboards and connectors that enable Tableau to access additional databases and applications, within their Tableau workflow. A redesigned notification experience displays a Tableau user's shares, comments, extracts and prep flows together in one dedicated space. This communicates all important changes across the organization. People can choose where to receive these notifications — directly in Tableau, email or both — ensuring they're aware of important alerts or updates. Quicker, easier Level of Detail (LOD) expressions let people use context menus or drag-and-drop a measure onto a dimension to automatically create a Level of Detail expression with the default aggregation. A new Salesforce Customer 360 Audiences Connector natively connects Tableau to Customer 360 Audiences, uncovering insights in detailed customer data. With the new connector, Tableau customers can explore by campaign, channel and multiple customer dimensions to understand the 'who' and 'why' behind their cross-channel engagement results.
2021.1 will be available later this month. To learn more about Business Science, visit:https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2021/3/what-is-tableau-business-science. To learn more about Tableau AI and analytics, visit:https://www.tableau.com/solutions/ai-analytics

Seattle (ots/PRNewswire) - Tableau 2021.1 bietet KI-generierte Vorhersagen, Erkenntnisse und automatisierte Erklaerungen, um Data Science einer groesseren Benutzerschaft zugaenglich zu machen
Tableau, die weltweit fuehrende Analyseplattform (NYSE: CRM) hat heute Business Science eingefuehrt, eine neue Klasse von KI-gestuetzten Analysen, die datenwissenschaftliche Techniken zugaenglicher macht und es Geschaeftsleuten und Analysten ermoeglicht, intelligentere Entscheidungen schneller zu treffen. In einem Markt, in dem Agilitaet der ultimative Wettbewerbsvorteil ist, ermoeglicht Business Science mehr Menschen Daten mit vereinfachter Modellerstellung, Vorhersagen, Was-waere-wenn-Szenarien, Prognosen und anderen Analysemethoden - und zwar alles per Klicks und ganz ohne Programmier-Codes.
Tableau wird Einstein Discovery in seinem 2021.1-Update liefern, dem ersten grossen Release, das Business Science unterstuetzt. Durch die Integration der vertrauenswuerdigen Vorhersagen und Empfehlungen von Einstein Discovery in Echtzeit in Tableau bekommen die Mitarbeiter ein besseres Verstaendnis davon, was passiert ist und warum, um die wahrscheinlichen Geschaeftsergebnisse vorhersehen zu koennen und entsprechende Massnahmen zu ergreifen. Seit mehr als fuenf Jahren hilft Einstein Discovery Salesforce-Kunden dabei, innerhalb von Minuten Einblicke in Muster von Millionen von Datenzeilen zu gewinnen und Muster zu verstehen, ohne dass dafuer ausgefeilte Datenmodelle erforderlich sind.
"Data Science ist heutzutage fuer die meisten Geschaeftskunden nicht greifbar. Geschaeftsanalysten zaehlen seit Langem auf Datenwissenschaftler, um mithilfe ausgefeilter Modelle aussagekraeftige und praezise Erkenntnisse zu gewinnen. Zu diesen Erkenntnissen zu gelangen, kann jedoch komplex, teuer und zeitaufwaendig sein", erklaerte Chandana Gopal, Forschungsleiterin fuer die Zukunft der Intelligenz bei IDC. "Waehrend Data Science zu leistungsstarken Erkenntnissen fuehren kann, muss manchmal zwischen Praezision und der Zeitdauer bis zum Erlangen dieser Erkenntnisse abgewogen werden. Business Science hat diesen Konflikt erkannt und versucht, Data Science fuer mehr Menschen zugaenglich und umsetzbar zu machen."
Business Science wird die Arbeit sowohl von Datenwissenschaftlern als auch von fortschrittlichen Analysten verbessern.
"Data Science war schon immer in der Lage, grosse Probleme zu loesen, aber allzu oft beschraenkt sich diese Leistung auf einige wenige ausgewaehlte Personen innerhalb eines Unternehmens", erklaerte Francois Ajenstat, Chief Product Officer bei Tableau. "Um wirklich datenbasierte Unternehmen aufzubauen, muessen wir die Macht, die diese Daten haben, so vielen Menschen wie moeglich zugaenglich machen. Die Demokratisierung von Data Science kann mehr Menschen dabei helfen, schneller bessere Entscheidungen zu treffen."
Kunden koennen Business Science nutzen, um beispielsweise die Effizienz der Lieferkette zu verbessern, die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Kaufs vorherzusagen oder das Angebot von Waren oder Dienstleistungen zu optimieren. Data Science koennte bei der Forschung und Entwicklung von Impfstoffen helfen, waehrend Business Science beim Vertrieb helfen und dazu beitragen koennte, dass schneller geimpft wird.
"Plattformen fuer maschinelles Lernen wie Einstein Discovery sind der naechste Schritt bei der Demokratisierung von Data Science", so Siddharth Dayama, Senior Manager of Data Analytics bei Verizon. "Das in Tableau integrierte Einstein Discovery erweitert das bereits vorhandene Inventar der Unternehmens-Dashboards um Vorhersagefunktionen. In Kombination mit automatisch generierten Modellen fuer maschinelles Lernen koennen die Unternehmen damit Muster, Trends und Korrelationen in ihren historischen Daten untersuchen, ohne auch nur eine einzige Zeile an Programmier-Code schreiben zu muessen. Die Ueberlagerung vorhandener BI-Infrastrukturen mit ML/KI-Funktionen eroeffnet zahlreiche Moeglichkeiten zur taeglichen Problemloesung."
Zu den zusaetzlichen Funktionen der Version 2021.1 gehoeren:
- Mit den neuen Verbesserungen der Microsoft Azure-Konnektivitaet koennen Benutzer eine Verbindung zu ihren Daten in der Azure SQL-Datenbank (mit Azure Active Directory) und in Azure Data Lake Gen 2 herstellen. Tableau unterstuetzt jetzt auch Azure Active Directory in zwei vorhandenen Connectors, Azure Synapse und Azure Databricks. - Mithilfe einer neuen Erweiterungsgalerie koennen die Benutzer in Tableau ganz einfach nach Konnektoren und Dashboard-Erweiterungen suchen und diese erkennen. In der Galerie koennen Kunden leicht Konnektoren und Dashboard-Erweiterungen erkennen und installieren, die ihre Dashboards und Konnektoren um Funktionen erweitern, mit denen Tableau innerhalb ihres Tableau-Workflows auf zusaetzliche Datenbanken und Anwendungen zugreifen kann. - Eine neu gestaltete Benachrichtigungsfunktion zeigt die Freigaben, Kommentare, Extrakte und Vorbereitungsablaeufe eines Tableau-Benutzers zusammen in einem eigenen Bereich an. Dadurch werden alle wichtigen Veraenderungen im gesamten Unternehmen kommuniziert. Die Benutzer koennen entscheiden, wo sie diese Benachrichtigungen erhalten moechten - direkt in Tableau, per E-Mail oder beides - um sicherzustellen, dass sie ueber wichtige Warnungen oder Updates informiert sind. - Mit schnelleren und einfacheren LOD-Ausdruecken (Level of Detail) koennen die Benutzer Kontextmenues verwenden oder eine Kennzahl per Drag & Drop auf eine Dimension ziehen, um automatisch einen LOD-Ausdruck mit der Standardaggregation zu erstellen. - Ein neuer Salesforce Customer 360 Audiences Connector verbindet Tableau nativ mit Customer 360 Audiences und ermoeglicht Einblicke in detaillierte Kundendaten. Mit dem neuen Konnektor koennen Tableau-Kunden nach Kampagne, Kanal und mehreren Kundendimensionen suchen, um zu verstehen, wer hinter ihren kanaluebergreifenden Interaktionsergebnissen steht und warum.
2021.1 wird noch diesen Monat verfuegbar sein.

Tableau Business Science: leistungsstarke Data Science-Funktionen für Geschäftsleute

Tableau 2021.1 bietet KI-generierte Vorhersagen, Erkenntnisse und automatisierte Erklärungen, um Data Science einer größeren Benutzerschaft zugänglich zu machen
 Tableau, die weltweit führende Analyseplattform (NYSE: CRM) hat heute Business Science eingeführt, eine neue Klasse von KI-gestützten Analysen, die datenwissenschaftliche Techniken zugänglicher macht und es Geschäftsleuten und Analysten ermöglicht, intelligentere Entscheidungen schneller zu treffen. In einem Markt, in dem Agilität der ultimative Wettbewerbsvorteil ist, ermöglicht Business Science mehr Menschen Daten mit vereinfachter Modellerstellung, Vorhersagen, Was-wäre-wenn-Szenarien, Prognosen und anderen Analysemethoden – und zwar alles per Klicks und ganz ohne Programmier-Codes.
Tableau wird Einstein Discovery in seinem 2021.1-Update liefern, dem ersten großen Release, das Business Science unterstützt. Durch die Integration der vertrauenswürdigen Vorhersagen und Empfehlungen von Einstein Discovery in Echtzeit in Tableau bekommen die Mitarbeiter ein besseres Verständnis davon, was passiert ist und warum, um die wahrscheinlichen Geschäftsergebnisse vorhersehen zu können und entsprechende Maßnahmen zu ergreifen. Seit mehr als fünf Jahren hilft Einstein Discovery Salesforce-Kunden dabei, innerhalb von Minuten Einblicke in Muster von Millionen von Datenzeilen zu gewinnen und Muster zu verstehen, ohne dass dafür ausgefeilte Datenmodelle erforderlich sind.
„Data Science ist heutzutage für die meisten Geschäftskunden nicht greifbar. Geschäftsanalysten zählen seit Langem auf Datenwissenschaftler, um mithilfe ausgefeilter Modelle aussagekräftige und präzise Erkenntnisse zu gewinnen. Zu diesen Erkenntnissen zu gelangen, kann jedoch komplex, teuer und zeitaufwändig sein", erklärte Chandana Gopal, Forschungsleiterin für die Zukunft der Intelligenz bei IDC. „Während Data Science zu leistungsstarken Erkenntnissen führen kann, muss manchmal zwischen Präzision und der Zeitdauer bis zum Erlangen dieser Erkenntnisse abgewogen werden. Business Science hat diesen Konflikt erkannt und versucht, Data Science für mehr Menschen zugänglich und umsetzbar zu machen."
Business Science wird die Arbeit sowohl von Datenwissenschaftlern als auch von fortschrittlichen Analysten verbessern.
„Data Science war schon immer in der Lage, große Probleme zu lösen, aber allzu oft beschränkt sich diese Leistung auf einige wenige ausgewählte Personen innerhalb eines Unternehmens", erklärte Francois Ajenstat, Chief Product Officer bei Tableau. „Um wirklich datenbasierte Unternehmen aufzubauen, müssen wir die Macht, die diese Daten haben, so vielen Menschen wie möglich zugänglich machen. Die Demokratisierung von Data Science kann mehr Menschen dabei helfen, schneller bessere Entscheidungen zu treffen."
Kunden können Business Science nutzen, um beispielsweise die Effizienz der Lieferkette zu verbessern, die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Kaufs vorherzusagen oder das Angebot von Waren oder Dienstleistungen zu optimieren. Data Science könnte bei der Forschung und Entwicklung von Impfstoffen helfen, während Business Science beim Vertrieb helfen und dazu beitragen könnte, dass schneller geimpft wird.
„Plattformen für maschinelles Lernen wie Einstein Discovery sind der nächste Schritt bei der Demokratisierung von Data Science", so Siddharth Dayama, Senior Manager of Data Analytics bei Verizon. „Das in Tableau integrierte Einstein Discovery erweitert das bereits vorhandene Inventar der Unternehmens-Dashboards um Vorhersagefunktionen. In Kombination mit automatisch generierten Modellen für maschinelles Lernen können die Unternehmen damit Muster, Trends und Korrelationen in ihren historischen Daten untersuchen, ohne auch nur eine einzige Zeile an Programmier-Code schreiben zu müssen. Die Überlagerung vorhandener BI-Infrastrukturen mit ML/KI-Funktionen eröffnet zahlreiche Möglichkeiten zur täglichen Problemlösung."
Zu den zusätzlichen Funktionen der Version 2021.1 gehören:
Mit den neuen Verbesserungen der Microsoft Azure-Konnektivität können Benutzer eine Verbindung zu ihren Daten in der Azure SQL-Datenbank (mit Azure Active Directory) und in Azure Data Lake Gen 2 herstellen.

SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2021
March 22: Vanderbilt University: Award-winning paleontologist to discuss how the past can help us conserve our future in virtual event March 24
The Vanderbilt Evolutionary Studies Initiative is hosting a free presentation by prominent paleoconservationist Michael Archer, who will discuss how understanding ancient life can help conservationists save endangered species today.
Archer, professor and head of the vertebrate paleontology laboratory and the Earth Sustainability Science Research Center at the University of New South Wales, will present "Paleoconservation: Learning from the past, to understand the present, to better conserve the future." The virtual event will be Wednesday, March 24, at 3:10 p.m. CT. The discussion is open to the public; registration is required.
Archer is best known for his scientific work on the Riversleigh World Heritage Site, a fossil site in northwestern Queensland that has revealed tens of thousands of specimens of more than 300 species. His early work on the site helped clarify the evolution of life in Australia, including a critical transition from rainforests hosting tree-dwellers to more open habitats that are now home to kangaroos.
Currently, Archer is focused on efforts to conserve the critically endangered alpine mountain pygmy-possum. He has determined that the possum's ancestors lived in much warmer forest wetlands, and Archer's work, combined with conservation efforts of the Prague Zoo and the Australian Ecosystems Foundation, has led to the establishing of a mountain pygmy-possum breeding facility in Secret Creek Sanctuary. This should enable experimental releases of the animal into its ancestors' preferred habitat.
In 2013, Archer and The Lazarus Project reported growing the first living cloned embryo from an extinct creature-the extraordinary gastric-brooding frog. He also is leading efforts to try to bring back the Tasmanian Tiger, which was last seen in the 1930s.
Archer has supervised more than 80 research student degrees, produced more than 400 scientific publications (including 15 books) and received a range of awards, including fellowships in the Australian Academy of Science, Royal Society of New South Wales, Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales, Australian College of Educators, Eureka Prize for Promoting Understanding of Science, Member of the Order of Australia, the Australian Centennial Medal from the Federal Government of Australia and the highest global award in the field of vertebrate paleontology: the Romer-Simpson Medal from the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in 2019.

March 15: Heritage Month Project celebrates diversity of Vanderbilt community
The Office for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the University Staff Advisory Council have partnered on an initiative to celebrate the myriad cultures, identities and voices that comprise the Vanderbilt community.
Launched in January 2021, the Heritage Month Project showcases events and individuals, including current Vanderbilt community members and alumni, through rotating poster displays at locations across campus. USAC's Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee selects the monthly themes and the events or individuals that are featured.
"The purpose of this project is to recognize the rich tapestry of experiences represented at the university and, through these campus displays, inform our community as well as celebrate the many identities, cultures and heritages that make up the Vanderbilt family," said Dr. Andre L. Churchwell, vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion and chief diversity officer for the university and for Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
The monthly displays celebrate the following themes, with more to be added throughout the year:
January - World Religions Day February - Black History Month March - Women's History Month April - Autism Awareness Month May - Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month June - LGBTQ+ Pride Month
The ground-mounted posters can be found in the West End Neighborhood, on Alumni Lawn near Rand Hall, on Library Lawn behind Godchaux Hall, along the main walkway near 21st Avenue South across from the Baker Building, near the base of the 21st Avenue pedestrian bridge on the Peabody College campus, on The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons near the Hobbs Building, and adjacent to the Highland Quad along 25th Avenue South.

March 15: Vanderbilt University: Unique transdisciplinary collaboration gives undergrads exposure to research experience in the humanities
Over the course of several weeks in September 2020, second-year student Alice Lillydahl found herself not just embarking on a new school year during a pandemic, but also joining daily Zoom calls and working remotely for about 20 hours per week as a member of a humanities research team at The Center for Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe). More specifically, the team researched various topics on genetic privacy in 21st-century literature, film and TV. Alice Lillydahl Alice Lillydahl
"We had 9 a.m. team meetings. In the pandemic world, where I barely left my house, having a reason to start the day and people to talk to made everything a little more normal," Lillydahl said. "I had work hours to get in and a responsibility to our group, which gave me a sense of purpose and a community that spoke to my interests as a public policy major and gender and sexuality studies minor."
Humanities research is often the pursuit of a solitary scholar, making the existence of this research team rare. It's also exceptional for having four undergraduates and a graduate student as first authors of articles published in a scholarly journal. Jay Clayton, William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of English and director of the Curb Center for Art, Enterprise and Public Policy, led the team's novel approach to literary studies, calling it "vertical integration" because, much like lab science, the method included undergraduates, graduate students and faculty in all aspects of the research process. Jay Clayton Jay Clayton
"It's unheard of in the humanities for undergraduates to get to participate in any meaningful way in research, so that's what's got me excited," Clayton said. "All of the students were fabulous-engaged, smart and hardworking."
In fact, the inclusion of undergraduates, graduate students and faculty collaborating on humanities research is not a model that Clayton had ever seen before.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued the following news release:
The Department of Attorney General has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Center for Cybersecurity and Data Science at Ferris State University, Attorney General Dana Nessel announced today.
The Department of Attorney General regularly conducts investigations that involve issues of cybersecurity and information technology. The Center for Cybersecurity and Data Science (CCDS) at Ferris State University (FSU) is comprised of experts in the field of cybersecurity. The MOU will allow the CCDS to provide volunteer consulting services to the Attorney General's Office to help combat crime. The CCDS is comprised of faculty from FSU's Information and Security Intelligence program.
"This partnership is a unique opportunity for my office to augment our resources to fight crime across all platforms," said Nessel. "Sophisticated criminals use technology to perpetrate crimes that range from consumer exploitation to domestic terrorism. I am fully committed to leveraging available resources in the field of cybersecurity to pursue and prosecute those criminals."
The Information and Security Intelligence (ISI) program at FSU is the only accredited cybersecurity program in Michigan. The program is a National Security Agency (NSA) Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense and was the first university program in the United States to be designated a Department of Defense Center of Digital Forensic Academic Excellence.
The program includes one faculty member who is embedded in the Michigan State Police Cyber Crime unit; two who are licensed professional investigators in the field of digital forensics; and a faculty member who is part of the Michigan MIC3, which is the State of Michigan's Civilian Cyber Corp organization.
The ISI program is lead by Dr. Greg Gogolin. Gogolin was the initial author of both the ISI undergraduate and graduate degree programs, which are ranked in the top 25 nationally. He is a Distinguished Professor and Fulbright Scholar (Universidad de Chile), and has taught in Latin American, Asia and Europe.
"We appreciate the opportunity to work with the Attorney General's office. I admire the determination that Attorney General Nessel possesses, particularly in the current environment. The challenges in cybercrime are significant, and we want people to feel confident that cybercrime will not continue unabated," said Gogolin.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer approved funding for a new building at FSU to house the Center for Virtual Learning in 2020. The Center will include secured evidence rooms, examination rooms, presentation rooms and Faraday rooms. Faraday rooms are secured from network and radio transmission, which is necessary when performing examination and experiments on things such as cell phones, mobile devices and malware analysis. This will be the only Faraday room in the State of Michigan.

New Data Science Can Unlock U.S.$20 Million Agriculture Insurance Business in East Africa

Allianz Africa is eyeing the agriculture insurance sector in Kenya and the East African region which they say is set to grow by 200 percent.
Allianz experts estimate that the value of the agriculture insurance segment to stand at $10 million but say it holds the potential to grow to $30 million. They aim at partnering with aggregators such as banks, cooperatives, agro-dealers, and commodity Associations to deploy the solution, said Lovemore Forichi, Senior Underwriter of Agriculture at Allianz Re
"According to our estimates, Agriculture Insurance Premium globally is USD 32 billion. East Africa contributes about USD18 million of which Kenya is about USD10 million. Governments and the Private Sector in East Africa are working together to increase agriculture insurance penetration in the region. Less than 5% of the Kenya farming community is insured," said Lovemore
Allianz, one of the world's leading insurers and asset managers, entered the East African market last year after signing an agreement with Jubilee Insurance to establish a strategic partnership in the five African countries where Jubilee Insurance currently operates.
The partnership covers the general insurance business (also known as the property & casualty insurance segment) in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda as well as the short-term insurance segment in Burundi and Mauritius. JHL retains its ownership of its Life and Pensions operations and its Medical insurance business in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
Lovermore says that Allianz aims at unlocking the potential using parametrics which is a non-traditional insurance product that offers pre-specified payouts based upon trigger events such as wind speed and rainfall measurements.
"Operationally, parametric solutions are less cumbersome as the insurance company does not need to visit the farm and occupy the farmer's time. Monitoring of the index can be done remotely through satellite imagery and data. The farmer can also have access to the data and they can closely monitor the development of the index throughout the growing season on their mobile phone or tablet. This also makes it very transparent, traceable, efficient, and paperless," said the official.
Through parametrics, farmers can choose which parameter is of concern to them, as far as affecting their crop yield is concerned. The most common parameter is rainfall. Lack of rainfall during the cropping season (drought) as well as too much rainfall (excessive rainfall) have a huge impact on the farmers' yield and subsequently the revenue.
So the farmer will choose to insure against drought and/or excessive rainfall to hedge their losses. When the insurance company uses index insurance solutions such as Rainfall Index, Evapotranspiration Index, Soil Moisture Index, and Area Yield Index, these are classified as parametric solutions.
Over the years, more insurance companies are venturing into the agricultural space as farmers are increasingly understanding the value of insurance as they learn from other people's experiences.
The Kenyan government and private sector are also actively contributing to the insurance penetration through premium subsidies for both crop and livestock farmers as only less than 5% of the Kenya farming community are insured.

Global realisation that "new oil" is data has been established beyond doubt and the miners of this extremely valuable commodity are the growing ilk of Data Scientists and Machine Learning professionals. Data Science (DS) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionising the way everyday world works. As per the World Economic Forum, by 2025, it is estimated that 463 exabytes of data will be created every day globally. To put this in perspective, this is equivalent to 212,765,957 DVDs per day. We are proceeding at a rapid clip towards a world of interconnected devices - and possibilities. This is captured in knowledge spheres with buzzwords like IoT - the Internet of Things, ML - Machine Learning and suchlike, as well as in common parlance through devices that are quickly becoming part of ubiquity amongst household must-haves like Amazon's Alexa, Google Home or Apple Homepod. One can't miss grown-ups as well as children nowadays quizzing voice-based assistants from these tech biggies to provide information, news, entertainment and even support to conduct everyday business as usual.

Further, these systems are being infused with algorithmic learning abilities that map usage and human interaction and brought into use across sectors ranging from home & personal use, to product intelligence and even governance & administration. The near future will see the commercial roll-out of automated traffic signals and self-driven cars. Users will be able to view the health of their devices & goods like their car as well as gauge their own health. Banking, insurance and Omnichannel retail will heavily tap into these data points to improve consumer experiences and allow systems, machines and interfaces to map responses and predict scenarios far before they occur. These technologies will also find utility in climate control, environmental change, medical & drug research and space exploration.
Given the all-pervasive nature of data, information and the ability of automated systems to learn from past behaviour and trends, which is going to be the norm of tomorrow, the world is not going to have enough, qualified and capable professionals to foster and manage these. India has always been the go-to destination for more than a decade for dependable, efficient systems professionals and with the rising need for Data Scientists and Machine Learning programming talent, we are poised at taking this mantle on, yet again.

The following information was released by the office of the Michigan Attorney General:
The Department of Attorney General has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Center for Cybersecurity and Data Science at Ferris State University, Attorney General Dana Nessel announced today.
The Department of Attorney General regularly conducts investigations that involve issues of cybersecurity and information technology. The Center for Cybersecurity and Data Science (CCDS) at Ferris State University (FSU) is comprised of experts in the field of cybersecurity. The MOU will allow the CCDS to provide volunteer consulting services to the Attorney Generals Office to help combat crime. The CCDS is comprised of faculty from FSUs Information and Security Intelligence program.
This partnership is a unique opportunity for my office to augment our resources to fight crime across all platforms, said Nessel. Sophisticated criminals use technology to perpetrate crimes that range from consumer exploitation to domestic terrorism. I am fully committed to leveraging available resources in the field of cybersecurity to pursue and prosecute those criminals.
The Information and Security Intelligence (ISI) program at FSU is the only accredited cybersecurity program in Michigan. The program is a National Security Agency (NSA) Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense and was the first university program in the United States to be designated a Department of Defense Center of Digital Forensic Academic Excellence.
The program includes one faculty member who is embedded in the Michigan State Police Cyber Crime unit; two who are licensed professional investigators in the field of digital forensics; and a faculty member who is part of the Michigan MIC3, which is the State of Michigans Civilian Cyber Corp organization.
The ISI program is lead by Dr. Greg Gogolin. Gogolin was the initial author of both the ISI undergraduate and graduate degree programs, which are ranked in the top 25 nationally. He is a Distinguished Professor and Fulbright Scholar (Universidad de Chile), and has taught in Latin American, Asia and Europe.
"We appreciate the opportunity to work with the Attorney General's office. I admire the determination that Attorney General Nessel possesses, particularly in the current environment. The challenges in cybercrime are significant, and we want people to feel confident that cybercrime will not continue unabated," said Gogolin.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer approved funding for a new building at FSU to house the Center for Virtual Learning in 2020. The Center will include secured evidence rooms, examination rooms, presentation rooms and Faraday rooms. Faraday rooms are secured from network and radio transmission, which is necessary when performing examination and experiments on things such as cell phones, mobile devices and malware analysis.

March 18, 2021: Supply Chain Institute: More Data Science Cheatsheets
News Bites - Private Companies

We recently realized that we hadn't brought you any data science cheatsheets in a while. And it's not for their lack of availability; data science cheatsheets are everywhere, ranging from the introductory to the advanced, covering topics from algorithms, to statistics, to interview tips, and beyond.
But what makes a good cheatsheet? What makes a cheatsheet worthy of being singled out as a particularly good one? It's difficult to put your finger on precisely what makes a good cheatsheet, but obviously one which conveys essential information concisely - whether that information is of a specific of general nature - is definitely a good start. And that is what makes our candidates today noteworthy. So read on for four curated complementary cheatsheets to assist you in your data science learning or review.
First up is Aaron Wang's Data Science Cheatsheet 2.0, a four page compilation of statistical abstractions, fundamental machine learning algorithms, and deep learning topics and concepts. It is not meant to be exhaustive, but instead a quick reference for situations such as interview preparation and exam reviews, and anything else requiring a similar level of review depth. The author notes that while those with a basic understanding of statistics and linear algebra would find this resource of most benefit, beginners should be able to glean useful information from its content as well.
Figure Screenshot from Aaron Wang's Data Science Cheatsheet 2.0
Our next cheatsheet offering today is that which Aaron Wang's resource is based on, Maverick Lin's Data Science Cheatsheet (Wang's reference to his own as 2.0 is a direct nod to Lin's "original"). We can think of Lin's cheatsheet as more in-depth than Wang's (though Wang's decision to make his less in-depth seems intentional and a useful alternative), covering more fundamental data science concepts such as data cleaning, the idea of modeling, doing "big data" with Hadoop, SQL, and even the basics of Python.
Clearly this will appeal to those who are more firmly in the "beginner" camp, and does a good job of whetting appetites and making readers aware of the broad field of data science, and many of the varying concepts which it encompasses. This is definitely another solid resource, especially if the reader is newcomer to data science.

February 09: Supply Chain Institute: FogHorn and IBM to Collaborate on Edge-to-Hybrid Cloud Solutions
FogHorn, a developer of edge computing AI software for industrial and commercial Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, today announced plans to collaborate with IBM.
The common goal is to provide an open and secured next-generation hybrid cloud platform with advanced, edge-powered artificial intelligence (AI) and closed-loop system control capabilities.
By bringing together edge and cloud capabilities, FogHorn and IBM plan to help supply chain managers rapidly deploy, process, store, analyze and train critical data from edge to cloud and enhance business processes.
Gartner estimates that enterprises will create and process greater than 50% of their data outside a traditional centralized data center or cloud by 2022. A more decentralized approach, powered by IoT and edge computing, can help to achieve increased ROI from digital transformation projects.
"With computing done in so many places-on public and private clouds and the edge-the challenge that businesses face is to connect all these different elements into a cohesive, end-to-end platform," said Chris Penrose, Chief Operating Officer at FogHorn. "Through our upcoming collaboration, FogHorn will leverage IBM Edge Application Manager to deliver edge-to-cloud FogHorn solutions for our customers that can help them make more informed decisions with their data, in real-time. Combining FogHorn's vertical expertise with IBM's cloud know-how, we will create the opportunity to address a wide range of edge use cases which has the potential to deliver operational savings, improved up-time, reduced waste and lower energy consumption."

February 08: IHS Markit Revises 2021 U.S. GDP Growth Forecast: A New Positive for Supply Chains
Economists now expect a "near certainty" of a $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus to drive supply chains and create jobs.
According to Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist and co-head US economics, IHS Markit, this comes against the backdrop of falling COVID-19 infection rates.
"There's been some relaxation of containment measures, and an acceleration of the national inoculation campaign," he adds. "This encouraged us to revise up our forecast of GDP growth for 2021 from 4.0% to 5.7%, and for 2022 from 3.9% to 4.1%."
Chris Varvares, co-head US economics, IHS Markit, concurs, noting that he expects this growth to push GDP past its previous peak by the middle of this year and eliminate the output gap in 2022.
The previous peak of employment will be regained in early 2023, and the unemployment rate is expected to decline to 3.5% by late 2024," he says.
"With such expansive fiscal policy providing for a quicker improvement in labor markets and an earlier rise in sustained inflation, we've revised our assumptions on monetary policy. We now expect the Fed to start raising the federal funds rate in mid-2024, more than two years earlier than previously assumed."

February 04: Supply Chain Redesign: Meeting the Needs of Tomorrows Customers
In the not-so-distant past, supply chain design seemed simpler. Deliveries typically went to industrial locations, like factories and warehouses; retail locations, like stores, strip plazas and malls; or, with the rise of e-commerce, directly to the consumer. Supply networks were relatively stable and for the most part, delivery windows were generous.
Like so many things in the last year, that's gone out the window. Supply chain leaders today, and in the future, will grapple with factors inside and outside the four walls of their facilities and organizations that will impact the design of their supply chains.

January 10: Supply Chain Institute: OM in the News: Manufacturings Circular Economy
With a raging pandemic, disrupted supply chains, and a growing scarcity of raw materials, 2021 will present serious challenges to the global manufacturing industry. American Machinist (Jan. 6, 2021) sees a renewed resolve among manufacturers to focus on sustainability and join the circular economy - the strategic effort to eliminate waste and the maintain a continual use of resources. Manufacturers are approaching the circular economy model by rethinking how they design and produce their products with as little waste as possible, how they ship them, and how they approach the growing after-market repair and recycling market.
The circular economy is putting pressure on companies to reexamine their business processes; not only to improve quality and profitability, but because an efficient supply chain consumes less energy, uses fewer resources, and produces less waste. In short, gearing production toward sustainability is good business.
One example is DyeCoo, a textile company that has partnerships with Nike and IKEA, has developed a water-free process for dyeing. Using highly pressurized, recyclable carbon dioxide instead of water, the company can produce its product in half the time, using a fraction of the energy of traditional methods. Another example is Cambrian Innovation. This U.S.company treats wastewater contaminated by industrial processes, not only turning it into clean water, but even producing biogas that can be used to generate clean energy.
Manufacturers also will need to reengineer, and in some cases reimagine, their products. This means building for longevity in a sustainable business plan. If you are a lighting fixture manufacturer selling light as a service to an airport, you will want to produce lightbulbs to last long as possible, to maximize 'uptime' and revenue.
Manufacturers are also taking serviceability into account in the design phase.

March 19: Supply Chain Institute: Cyber Attacks in Manufacturing: How to Protect Your Company
Editor's note: Mark Dohnalek is President & CEO of Pivot International, US-based global manufacturing, technology, engineering & product development firm.
Watch out manufacturers because criminals are lurking, using new techniques to defeat legacy security measures, resulting in a 260% increase in cyber attacks. According to the 2020 State of Encrypted Attacks report, the manufacturing sector is the most targeted industry for malicious browser breaches, comprising 38.6% of attacks.
These attacks often result in theft of customer data, intellectual property, and other valuable information, which cybercriminals may exploit themselves or sell to the highest bidder.
Just as importantly, a cyber attack can take down a company's entire IT system and bring its operations to a virtual halt, resulting in untold amounts of lost revenue. The risk has become too great to ignore, and leaders must take steps to protect their company and their customers. Unfortunately, as an industry, manufacturers struggle with the technological obsolescence of legacy network equipment.
These systems often precede the digital revolution and were not designed to defend against data breaches. Between fragmentation and technological obsolescence, manufacturing company security systems have wide gaps making them vulnerable to cyber threats.
The question, then, is how can leaders successfully go about this? Here are X ways to protect your company and guard against malicious browser breaches.

March 18: Supply Chain Institute: How to frame the right questions to be answered using data
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses the scientific method, processes, and algorithms to extract knowledge and insights from data. The field of data science has several subdivisions, such as data mining, data transformation, data visualization, machine learning, deep learning, etc. In this article, we will focus on how to ask meaningful questions that could be answered using data. The quality of any analysis performed on data depends on your ability to frame the right questions. The following tips will help you to frame the right questions to be addressed with data.
Explore your data: Before performing any analysis on your data, it is important to explore the available data carefully. This would help you understand the scope of the data, its quality, its type (ordinal or categorical; static or dynamic), patterns in the data, and relationships between features in the data. Determine the type of problem to be addressed using the data: Depending on your dataset, the problem to be solved could fall under one of the following categories: descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, or prescriptive analytics. These three categories of data science tasks will be discussed in greater details in the case studies section below.
March 18: Supply Chain Institute: Wrangle Summit 2021: All the Best People, Ideas, and Technology in Data Engineering, All in One Place
The most interesting and opportunity-rich area of the data lifecycle happens in the work before the actual analysis. This exciting work is absolutely essential to the success of any data-driven project. It's where new data products are born. It's where messy data is transformed into something beautiful and valuable. It's where the magic happens.
Who makes that magic happen? Data engineers.
Data engineering, as a discipline, is hot. It's the fastest growing job in technology. A recent study from job listing site Dice shows demand for data engineers was up 50% in 2020.
"Much of the work done by data scientists proves to be very difficult without the support of data engineers," Dice reports in 2020: The Year of the Citizen Data Engineer. "The volume, velocity, and variety of data available increases daily, and data engineers are fundamental to ensuring their success by creating scalable, reliable, and efficient systems for processing and delivering data."
The central theme that runs through all of this is that data has become the frontier for competition and the ability to create unique, high quality data products based on increasingly diverse and constantly changing data sources will play a huge role in separating the winners from the losers in the next decade.
If you move, structure, clean, or pipeline data to drive critical enterprise decisions, you're doing the work of data engineering.
March 17: Supply Chain Institute: Air Cargo Supply Chains Rebounding in Asia Pacific
With the Pacific Rim driving most of the growth, air cargo demand has shown significant gains for the first time since the COVID-19 crisis surfaced last year.
Two leading industry associations have issued positive forecasts for 2021, with Boeing telling shippers it will produce aircraft to meet their future payload needs.
Preliminary 2021 traffic figures released by the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) showed that airline operations are still depressed, as the spread of COVID-19 variants resulted in tighter border restrictions in international as well as domestic markets across the world.
Nonetheless, air cargo demand keeps improving as world trade gains momentum. Growth in the e-commerce sector is keeping stride with the further recovery in the global manufacturing sector supporting air cargo markets, but the depressed passenger business is still a concern.
"Renewed efforts to contain COVID-19 through lockdowns and border restrictions have again affected international passenger demand, which remains close to a standstill," says AAPA Director General, Subhas Menon.
He adds that the uneven roll-out of vaccinations across the world will only delay the full reopening of borders.
"In this extremely challenging operating environment, airlines are struggling to survive.
March 17: Supply Chain Institute: Data Annotation: tooling & workflows latest trends
The development of AI applications, from robotic perception to self-driving cars, require millions of data points to be annotated, often by human eyes and hands. In this post, iMerit, a leader in providing high-quality data for Machine Learning and AI, delivers its predictions on processes and technology improvements that will make data annotation cheaper and more efficient.
For a deeper dive into these trends and to speak to an expert who can help kickstart your data project, &#8203; follow this link.
Predictive annotation tools are tools that can automatically detect and label items based on similar manual annotation. In computer vision workflows, these tools can annotate subsequent frames after the first few are manually marked. Human innovation is still required for QA and edge cases, the new key differentiator when selecting a data annotation partner.
Customized reporting. &#8203; While working with large expert data annotation teams, reporting on a project progress will become granular at an individual's level, and dynamic through the use of APIs and open source tools. This will allow for informed decision making through the project's lifecycle.
Focus on quality control. When working with large data sets, teams focused exclusively on edge cases and quality control will be built, comprising experts with deep understanding of the data and its subject matter.

March 17: Supply Chain Institute: Recommender Systems: A Machine Learning Solution for the Oil and Gas Industry
Editor's Note: The SCM thesis Reducing Oil Well Downtime with a Machine Learning Recommender System was authored by Jesus Madrid and Andrew Min and supervised by Dr. Cansu Tayaksi (ctayaksi@mit.edu). For more information on the research, please contact the thesis supervisor.
The oil and gas industry has seen many ups and downs in the last 20 years. Since 2014 in particular, the industry has been feeling the crunch, as prices are well below all-time highs of over $100 per barrel. Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has wiped out a third of the global demand for oil, sending prices below $20 per barrel, and at one point reaching unprecedented negative values.
This capital-intensive industry is plagued by unplanned downtime at its refineries, offshore platforms, and oil wells, resulting in unnecessary high maintenance costs and risk exposure.
In this current low-price environment, oil and gas companies must prioritize operational efficiency. To do so, companies are beginning to lean on advanced analytics utilizing Big Data and machine learning to reduce downtime and its associated costs.
In today's global and digital world, recommender systems help us make decisions in our everyday lives.
March 17: Supply Chain Institute: Automating Machine Learning Model Optimization
Creating a machine learning model is a difficult task because we need to make a model which works best for our data and we can optimize for better performance and accuracy. Generally making a machine learning model is easy but find out the best parameters and optimizing is a time taking process.
There are certain libraries/packages which allow you to automate this process and make machine learning models effortlessly. We can use these packages to select the best model for our data and also the best parameters for the model.
In this article, we will be discussing Bayesian tuning and bandits (BTB) which is used to select and hyperparameter tune the best model to solve a given machine learning problem. We will explore different functionalities that are provided for BTB for machine learning.
Let's get started
Installing Required Libraries
In this article, we will be using Google Colab. Let's install the required library i.e, BTB by using the command given below

March 09: Supply Chain Institute: The future of supply chain management is AI and Data
Because enterprises are like organisms in an economic ecosystem, the principles that enable a healthy biological ecosystem are, from a physical, chemical and informational perspective, identical to those that enable a healthy business ecosystem and that ensure the survival of members of that business ecosystem. Value is created by solving problems through the application of information and creativity. By speeding the information flows and reducing inefficiencies, we are equipping our part of the bigger picture to operate effectively, adapt quickly and evolve to meet competitive threats and exploit opportunities in the environment.
Supply chains are a crucial and complex part of the information flowing in this ecosystem. They are an intricately structured and variable system that is highly sensitive, with many possible outcomes based on even minor changes in the initial conditions or components. Supply chains feature a large collection of interacting components that are difficult to understand or examine due to their design and operations. And they represent a system in process, changing and developing over time.
It's critical to think holistically about the information ecosystem as you prepare the digital representation of various stages of product design and development.
March 07: Supply Chain Institute: Guest Post: Smoking Forecasting and Product Life Cycle
drop can be seen in the figure below and it clearly is following an almost straight line, which makes forecasting very easy using the trend projection method discussed in Chapter 4.
Some of the more recent decline can be attributed to the introduction of e-cigarettes and vapes. However, smoking is on the rise again during this current pandemic which means that time-series forecasting methods, which rely on past data, would not be very useful for forecasting sales of cigarettes in the foreseeable future.

March 05: Supply Chain Institute: OM in the News: The Pandemic and the Drive-Through
The pandemic is sparking a boom in an often-overlooked type of property, the drive-through, reports The Wall Street Journal (March 3, 2021). Food halls and restaurants have taken a big hit from frequent limits on seating capacity during the Covid-19 crisis. But chains such as Chick-fil-A, McDonald's, and Checkers & Rally's said they are enjoying a sales uptick at stores with drive-through lanes, which have become more popular during the pandemic. As we discuss in the Chapter 9's Global Company Profile on layout at McDonald's (pages 368-9), drive-throughs have been ubiquitous since the 1970s. Now they are critical. "You can pull up in your car and stay socially distant," said one industry CEO.
Burger King's triple drive-through
Even restaurant chains that have never offered drive-through options are rolling out lanes. Shake Shack is building its first drive-through this year in Orlando. Some restaurant chains that already rely on drive-throughs are bulking up with even grander versions, in part to help meet a rise in digital orders. Burger King unveiled plans for future restaurants designed with triple drive-through lanes. One of the lanes would be reserved for customers who order online.
Many Checkers & Rally's restaurants feature double drive-through lanes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.
March 04: Supply Chain Institute: Start a career in Computer Science with Penns Master in Computer Science and Information Technology
The Master of Computer and Information Technology degree (MCIT) offered by the University of Pennsylvania is an online masters degree in Computer Science tailored for non-Computer Science majors. This new program brings the long-running, established on-campus MCIT degree online. The MCIT program empowers students without computer science backgrounds to succeed in computing and technology fields. MCIT students come from diverse academic backgrounds ranging from business and history to chemistry and medicine.
This program fosters a rich and inclusive community for students, granting access to core university services that support their well-being and future career goals. This support, combined with a strong alumni network and career services, prepares students to succeed even if they are new to the tech industry. Upon completion of the degree, on-campus MCIT alumni have gone on to earn jobs with competitive salaries at leading technology companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Bloomberg.
Interested in what it's like to take a course from the degree? Penn Engineering Online Learning recently launched a new Specialization called Introduction to Programming with Python and Java that samples some of the lecture videos and content from the first course in the program.
March 04: Supply Chain Institute: Sharing the Reverse Mission
As we noted in "Leveraging "The Loop" Key to Profits This Year," the volume of returned inventory continues to rise for supply chain managers in a variety of industry sectors.
"Towards the Circular Economy," a recent report published by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, notes that conversations about circular economy (CE) are increasing.
The concept - an economic model that encourages continuous reuse of materials to minimize waste, as well as driving demand for natural resource consumption - has been described by Gartner as starting "good design, end of life and raw material reuse in mind."
According to Gartner analyst, Patrick Van Hull, 51% of logistics managers expect their focus on circular economy strategies to increase in 2021.
"This requires a complete shift in how we view supply chains, from a linear to a circular model, as companies will need to be able to access and reprocess end-of-life products," he says.
Caterpillar, IKEA, Philips Lighting, Rolls Royce, Timberland and Nestle are all developing circular economy initiatives, while others are building "CE" departments and hiring talent, Gartner adds.
Consistent with the mission of reverse logistics, a circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design.

Pandas is the beloved workhorse of the PyData toolkit - it makes incredibly diverse data analysis and data science tasks possible, using a user-friendly and robust API. PyPi indicates that pandas is downloaded approximately 5 million times a week around the world.
However, pandas does struggle to meet the data scientist's needs in a few cases where high volumes of data or unusually resource-intensive computation are required. In this article, we'll discuss a few of the areas where users might find that Dask tools help expand the existing pandas functionality without requiring changes of language or API.

March 04: Supply Chain Institute: OM in the News: More AI From the Start Up Nation
This past week, The Wall Street Journal ran three separate articles on more high-tech research coming out of Israel. These complement the blogs we have earlier done on Israeli firms producing 3-D printed hearts (April 23, 2019), warehouse robotics (Nov. 12, 2020), computer vision systems (Nov. 21, 2018), and 3-D printed steaks (Feb. 2, 2019). Here are the latest:
First, about 7.5 million people in the U.S. have trouble using their voices. So Amazon other AI tech providers is working on tools to enable voice-activated digital assistants to understand users with a stutter and other speech impairments. Amazon's Alexa integration, with software developed by Israeli startup Voiceitt, lets people with speech impairments train an algorithm to recognize their own unique vocal patterns (WSJ, Feb, 24, 2021). Training voice assistants to respond to people with speech disabilities could improve the experience of voice-recognition tools for a growing group of potential users, such as seniors, who are more prone to degenerative diseases.
Second, Israel's ALYN Hospital is developing a wheelchair-mounted robot arm powered by AI chips designed to mimic the way the human brain works, a technology known as neuromorphic computing.
March 04: Supply Chain Institute: Reducing the High Cost of Training NLP Models With SRU++
The increasing computation time and costs of training natural language models (NLP) highlight the importance of inventing computationally efficient models that retain top modeling power with reduced or accelerated computation. A single experiment training a top-performing language model on the 'Billion Word' benchmark would take 384 GPU days and as much as $36,000 using AWS on-demand instances.

Natural language models have achieved various groundbreaking results in NLP and related fields [1, 2, 3, 4]. At the same time, the size of these models have increased enormously, growing to millions (or even billions) of parameters, along with a significant increase in the financial cost.
The cost associated with training large models limits the research communities ability to innovate, because a research project often needs a lot of experimentation. Consider training a top-performing language model [5] on the Billion Word benchmark. A single experiment would take 384 GPU days (6 days * 64 V100 GPUs, or as much as $36,000 using AWS on-demand instances).

This week, the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the UBA inaugurated the data sciences career. What's this about? Why are "data" fashionable? What job exit could those who take it have? How might your graduates offer answers to specific problems and social needs? Why might knowledge in the area be useful in the middle of the pandemic? About all this, Pablo Groisman, associate professor in the Department of Mathematics, Researcher of the Conicet and director of the new career, talks about this.
 -What are the data sciences and what is their object of study?
-So far his subject matter of study was not as well defined as in the case of other sciences. There are many lines that come from the specialty in data and each expert on the subject will probably give you a different answer. As a mathematician, I'll think of it in a completely different way than computer science and those that come from the business area. The approach we try to generate for this new career includes a lot of math and a lot of computing. At first we need it because we believe that the handling of numbers is fundamental and the second because, in the present, we work with large volumes of data. The idea is that students are nourished by tools from various fields.
-Historically, disciplines such as physics or sociology were devoted to the study of data.
-Yes, physics is one of the most noteed although in recent years others have emerged. Biology and chemistry, but also social ones, are based on the management of a lot of information. All were incorporating the use of the data to try to understand their respective study objects a little more. It can be from understanding and analyzing a table of values, the distribution of income in a population, the comparison of heights in "X" year olds, or the economy and productivity levels of a nation. After the analysis of the comparative information, what comes is to train yourself in drawing interesting conclusions from it. In the field of Data Science it is what is known as "purpose", that is, what you want to do with everything collected. Many seek to do business and others pretend to understand a part of the world.
-Would the contribution of graduates and graduates in Data Sciences serve to address a phenomenon such as the evolution of the pandemic?
-Exactly. There is a lot of data going around that needs to be systematized and leveraged. Today Argentina requires people with skill in mathematical and computational modeling, as well as the implementation of algorithms to perform simulations and inferences. From the information collected it would be possible to understand what the dynamics of the expansion of the epidemic are like. In fact, the present offers us a classic scenario of the practical usefulness that the graduates of the race might have. Style problems there are many, both in the public and private sectors, in the academy but also in the productive field. Also everything related to operational research and process optimization. The area of action of the field is very wide; a typical example is the work done by Guillermo "Willy" Duran, one of the drivers of the race. His contributions relate to finding the best fixture for the Argentine football championship. The framework for action is very broad.
-Those who today provide data analysis to understand what happens to covid-19 have origins in different disciplines.
-People who are producing data and showing tables on media and social networks, in general, are people who have made a very important trajectory, and are very well formed. In fact, some of the ones we're seeing with a lot ofpublic presence are part of the teaching staff we make up. Our idea is to mix everyone in this career: there are specialists in statistics, computing, theoretical and applied mathematics and in all experimental disciplines. Everyone brings their vision to the specific handling of problems.
-Is this the first undergraduate career to deal with data science, big data, Machine Learning and Data Analysis at the local level?
-Many disciplinary spaces are being created. However, the vast majority of the academic offering points to graduate studies without undergraduate studies. In the next ten years, from my perspective, we will be seeing very large growth in these disciplines because there is huge demand. We are pioneers in the same way as Guillermo Brown National University, which holds his bachelor's degree. At the UBA, to be honest, he was born a little by chance as an update of the Bachelor's Degree in Applied Mathematics. Discussions around the program were leading us directly to create a new career.
-Can anyone score? What's the tour like?
-Yes, anyone who has completed their secondary studies. First there is the CBC, then a second cycle of compulsory subjects (training with a lot of mathematics, computing and data) and finally the third cycle, which is completely optional. There we propose some ways for students to specialize in that branch with which they feel most comfortable: Data Science, operational research, continuous modeling, atmosphere study, image processing and signals. We believe that there is a large majority that will turn to the data part because it is what is fashionable and in the greatest demand, but we do not like to neglect the other areas either. The needs of the moment are the ones that guide the creation of many careers. Currently no discipline is exempt from the use of data; therefore, it was so important to have glimpsed that gap that there was to decide to create one's own. Within the same Faculty, we have warned that many experimental research groups require a specialist in the field. They could use a person - at least - with this training within their laboratories. If we manage to train many graduates in this specialty, the various areas of knowledge could be nurtured very well. At the same time, we also hope that much of our graduates will leave the academy and manage to insert themselves very well on the productive map (public and private) of Argentina. We want a career that produces knowledge for society.

Data Science Hiring Process At PayPal
Contify Banking News
March 19, 2021 Friday 6:30 AM EST

March 19 -- PayPal issued the following news release:
- In terms of educational background, PayPal looks for candidates with programming, statistics, economics, and mathematics background with a focus on logical reasoning, data interpretation and a programming mindset.
PayPal, one of the largest online payment processing firm globally, has several data science teams working as Center of Excellence (CoE). For instance, Customer Support Intelligence focuses on research and development to solve NLP issues at scale. On the other hand, Global Data Science, Risk Analytics, Workforce Planning and Forecasting, Merchant & Consumer Analytics are focused on enabling Business/Risk/Compliance and work in a global construct.
We got in touch with V. Chandramouliswaran, Sr. Director, Global Financial Crimes and Customer Protection & Chennai Centre Head, PayPal India, to understand the hiring process for data scientists at the company.
Skills Required
PayPal mainly focuses on two critical areas while hiring data scientists - functional skills and business. On the functional side, preference is given to candidates with machine learning skills, OpenCV and deep learning. "We also recruit many Business Analytics individuals for whom the data science functional experience requirement is less onerous," said Chandramouliswaran.
On the business side, experience in payments, banking, risk, customer management, marketing experience is a huge plus.
In terms of educational background, PayPal looks for candidates with programming, statistics, economics, and mathematics background with a focus on logical reasoning, data interpretation and a programming mindset. "However, we have never focused on hiring only from top-tier institutes and are happy to provide opportunities to top talent with the right skill set and passion for solving large scale problems and driving global impact.
"For us at PayPal, skills and educational background are not as important as experience and exposure," added Chandramouliswaran. Candidates who have worked with big data, built data science models, solved pressing business problems are preferred." We look to hire talent that constantly challenges us and pushes us to innovate every day."
Interview Process
The interview process at PayPal consists of two significant steps:
Screening by talent acquisition and business teams: The first step is screening by the talent acquisition team, who spend about 20-45 minutes explaining the role and understanding the fitment. The business team then spends about 30-45 minutes explaining the roadmap, challenges and cultural fitment.
Interview process: Post the screening, the candidate goes through an average of five rounds of interviews, each lasting 45-60 minutes covering the fundamentals of data science, ability to program and work with data, ML Libraries (for engineering DS roles) and also address a business case on analytics or model development.
Chandramouliswaran said one of the critical challenges in recruiting is the limited availability of talent for niche skill sets such as NLP and deep learning. Other challenges include a lack of understanding of the digital payments/fintech ecosystem's nuances and strong business acumen. "Data scientists, in general, go around with a hammer in their hand looking for a nail, and that is the biggest challenge," he said.
Chandramouliswaran highlighted the typical mistakes in data scientists' hiring process:
* Not doing due diligence and completing all key fundamentals of the hiring process. Late hire is always better than a wrong hire.
* Not following a consensus-driven approach.
* Not exposing the candidates to real-time business problems and consumer impacting decisions.
PayPal addresses such pitfalls by evaluating candidates based on their approach to solve real-time problems and implementing the solutions using a small dataset, and exposing the candidate to PayPal's values, people, work and work culture.
PayPal primarily relies on traditional ways to recruit data scientists, such as outbound efforts via job boards, campaigns, and referrals. Some of the non-traditional ways include connecting with potential talent during events, meet-ups and networking platforms.
PayPal posts most of the data science roles on its website.
Interview Questions At PayPal
The questions depend on the nature of the role. If the role has a heavy data science tilt, then the candidate would be expected to demonstrate a sound understanding of cutting-edge algorithms and will have to engage in a dialogue on 'what' works and 'why', explains Chandramouliswaran.
For the Business Analytics role, guesstimate-type questions are asked. "Outside of these, there will be questions on the data skills that a person possesses, an ability to pull, scrub and analyse etc. Needless to say, the candidate needs to be comfortable with a programming language of his or her choice," he said.
Being A Data Scientist At PayPal
PayPal believes in inclusive hiring. The skill sets PayPal look for include:
* Real-world data science problems solving skills
* Question the 'why' behind the problem and rejecting a one size fits all approach
* Strive to understand the business
* Always put the team ahead of themselves
* Identify themselves with PayPal's values
A data scientist at PayPal is expected to carry responsibilities such as problem structuring, data preparation, model & strategy building, model & strategy validation, benefits measurement, and more. "A huge expectation is also in being comfortable with ambiguity. There have been many instances in which problems will be poorly defined, and having the requisite business background to engage in a dialogue to get to a well-defined and impactful problem statement collectively will be a differentiator," he said.
Paypal provides ample opportunities for data scientists to grow through:
* Using real-time data to solve end-user problems
* Building landscapes that make technology more accessible for users who are not digital natives
* Working with large datasets that support critical decision-making
* Building consumer-friendly products and solutions
"With several data science functions located in India, careers can grow both laterally and vertically," he said.
Pro Tips
For an analytics professional who wishes to carve out a career in the analytics industry, Chandramouliswaran advises them to be comfortable with data and numbers, and have an innate curiosity and problem-solving skills. "Building the right skill set through courses and competitions along with solving real-world problems will set the stage for people interested in analytics well on their way," he said.

(TNSRes) -- St. Olaf College issued the following news:
We are living in an increasingly data-driven world, with data literacy a highly sought-after skill by employers. At St. Olaf College, the Introduction to Data Science course provides students from all disciplines the opportunity to learn data analysis and visualization.
Taught within the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS) Department, this introductory course teaches students the basics of data science, an emerging field that seeks to gain information and make decisions based on collected data. By learning to interpret data and make it visually accessible for others, students understand the importance of data and its applicability to everyday issues.
"We want to empower students to use real, messy data to answer interesting questions by finding and scraping data, tidying and transforming the data, and ultimately creating visualizations that tell a compelling story," says Kenneth O. Bjork Distinguished Professor of Statistics and Data Science Paul Roback '89. "At its heart, data science is about gleaning information and making decisions from data. Knowledge of how to organize, visualize, and analyze data has never been a more important or marketable skill."
Since Introduction to Data Science is one of the requirements for the Statistics and Data Science concentration, many students interested in pursuing careers in data science take the course during their time at St. Olaf. However, the class is ultimately designed to give any student a basic understanding of data visualization, and can complement many majors. In fact, the course has led many students outside of the MSCS department to work with data after graduation. For psychology major Emily Patterson '20, the course was instrumental in shaping her career interests.
"This class informed my decision to focus on data science rather than psychology as my career. I always liked statistics and math, but did not see myself majoring in either of those subjects. I wanted to concentrate in statistics to improve my chances of getting a psychology job, but I really enjoyed this course and it encouraged me to continue taking higher-level statistics classes at St. Olaf," Patterson says. "It made me realize I could see myself doing this work full time."
Patterson now works as an associate data scientist in Downers Grove, Illinois. Although she did not have experience with data science prior to taking the course, Patterson quickly caught on to the material and received the support she needed to succeed.
"The class encouraged working collaboratively, and throughout the classes we would walk through code together, which was very helpful to my understanding of the material. There was a lot of code from class available to help with assignments and to reference throughout," Patterson says. "In both Intro to Data Science and Statistics for Science, there is a learning curve when being introduced to R, a programming language, but the professors are always available during class and office hours to help you along."
Megan Backhaus '19, a biology major and statistics concentrator who now works as a data scientist with UnitedHealth Group, also found the class highly accessible and foundational for students outside of the MSCS department.
"I found the Intro to Data Science class to really help with my coding skills. I became a proficient coder after this course. The thing I love about all the statistics and data science courses offered at St. Olaf is that they are so applicable to everyday practice. I use the code packages taught in this class every day at work," Backhaus says. "I feel really lucky that I created my data science foundation in this class. Professor Roback touches on a lot of important aspects of data science all in one semester! By taking this course, I was prepared for my first day on the job."
In addition to teaching students the foundations of data science, the course also allows them to create their own project using existing data. By the end of the course, each student publishes a web page that tells a data-driven story about a topic of their choice. The websites, built with coding programs like Shiny Apps or RPubs, often utilize interactive graphics that aid viewers in understanding the information. Past projects have explored data on topics including NASA findings on stars and constellations, the activity of squirrels in New York, and patterns of dialogue in Star Wars movies.
"This was a really cool project," Backhaus says. "I actually create Shiny Apps frequently to share results at work. Shiny Apps are a great way to share visualizations with others, giving the viewer a lot of power to decide what they want to look at."
For her web page, Backhaus visualized breweries across the United States, mapping them by latitude and longitude so viewers could identify breweries in their area. Patterson's web page focused on environmental conditions and their effect on physical health. These projects allowed the students to wrangle data in ways that are applicable to our current world and develop skills that are aiding them beyond their time at St. Olaf.
"The foundational skills I learned in this class help me every day while I create interactive dashboards for business stakeholders to better visualize findings so they can make decisions," Backhaus says. "Without this class, I don't think I would have found a career in data science!"

Maze Therapeutics, a company translating genetic insights into new precision medicines, today revealed its first three lead therapeutic candidates in the company's wholly owned pipeline. The candidates include:
An oral therapy targeting GYS1 for the treatment of Pompe disease
An oral therapy targeting APOL1 for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
A gene therapy targeting ATXN2 for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
Each of the three lead candidates was enabled by Maze's COMPASS platform, which uncovered important new findings for the genetic target, discerning which specific signals may be critical for the treatment of patients, and which are likely non-actionable. The Maze pipeline will have the potential to serve as precision medicines for rare diseases and mechanistically defined subsets of common diseases based on certain genetic drivers.
In addition, Maze is concurrently leveraging COMPASS to advance additional discovery-stage research programs across three main therapeutic areas of focus: metabolic, cardio/renal and neurological diseases. These programs will constitute a broad, diverse pipeline for Maze and will be a combination of wholly owned and partnership-led collaborations.
"Maze was built by co-founders, including Charles Homcy and other preeminent thinkers in the field of genetics, on a bold vision - to leverage growing knowledge of genetic drivers of disease in order to create precision medicines for the treatment of both rare and more common diseases," said Jason Coloma, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Maze. "Since our founding, we have been leveraging insights from leading geneticists, combined with the growing availability of paired human genetic and clinical data, the evolution of functional genomic technologies and advances in computational power, to build our COMPASS platform in order to bring unique insights into efficient, genetics-based drug development. We are excited by the significant progress we have made with our platform and pipeline, bringing us an important step closer to our goal of delivering the right drug to the right patient at the right time."
Maze's therapeutic candidates are designed to: 1) target genes whose activity affects the phenotype associated with another, often distant, gene, referred to as genetic modifiers; 2) mimic the activity of protective genetic variants; 3) correct the effects of toxic genetic variants; or 4) leverage new genetic insights to address otherwise challenging drug targets.
COMPASS is a proprietary, purpose-built platform that combines human genetic data, functional genomic tools and data science technology to map novel connections between known genes and their influence on susceptibility, timing of onset and rate of disease progression. In addition, Maze is exploring applications of COMPASS in diseases of haploinsufficiency by identifying genetic mechanisms that increase levels of a deficient protein and translating them into therapeutics.
"New findings using COMPASS helped fill in fundamental data gaps, turning known but challenging targets into exciting, differentiated approaches to the genetic drivers of disease for our first three programs," said Sarah Noonberg, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Maze. "While it has been shown that targets with human genetic evidence are more likely to yield efficacious treatments, very few groups have had the capabilities to then turn genetic insights into viable drug programs. We believe our COMPASS platform, integrated with our extensive drug discovery capabilities, will allow us to accelerate the pace of therapeutic development, as well as increase the likelihood of producing therapies that provide meaningful clinical benefit for patients. We are excited to advance these initial programs and look forward to continued progress toward the clinic as efficiently as possible."
About Maze's Wholly Owned Programs
GYS1 Program for Pompe Disease
Pompe disease is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 40,000 live births in the U.S., and is estimated to affect 5,000 to 10,000 patients worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the GAA gene, which codes for an enzyme responsible for breaking down lysosomal glycogen into glucose. As a result of this mutation, glycogen accumulates in various tissues, particularly skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues, causing progressive weakness and respiratory insufficiency.
Maze is developing a novel, oral approach to treating Pompe disease by inhibiting the protein muscle glycogen synthase, which is encoded by the gene GYS1. Targeting this protein leads to reduction in the synthesis of glycogen, which is expected to restore glycogen balance through a mechanism called substrate reduction. While GYS1 has been a therapeutic target of interest, its attractiveness as a therapeutic target has been limited due to its structural complexity and uncertainties related to the tolerability of a long-term reduction in muscle glycogen levels. Critical insights derived from COMPASS have enabled Maze to overcome these challenges. Maze has interrogated the structurally complex protein to develop an oral inhibitor of muscle glycogen synthase, a target not previously addressable by small molecule therapies. Maze is rapidly progressing its GYS1 program toward an Investigational New Drug application and expects to initiate clinical trials in the first half of 2022.
APOL1 Program for Chronic Kidney Disease
CKD affects approximately 37 million people in the U.S., including more than 700,000 patients who suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), many of whom require chronic dialysis. Individuals of African ancestry are at an approximately 3.5-fold greater risk of developing ESRD than individuals of European ancestry. Previous studies have shown that two coding variants of the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) encoded by the gene APOL1 cause toxic gain-of-function variants and are important genetic drivers of kidney disease that are responsible for much of the increased risk for CKD and ESRD in individuals of African ancestry. There are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying causes of APOL1-associated CKD, and efficacious treatment options for individuals with APOL1 risk variants and CKD represent a significant unmet medical need.
Maze employed COMPASS to functionalize human genetic variants to uncover the underlying biology of the target and has designed a small molecule that corrects the effects of toxic gain-of-function variants to potentially enable a therapeutic solution. Maze plans to name the development candidate in early 2022.
ATXN2 Program for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
ALS is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease with a prevalence of approximately 16,000 patients in the U.S. Current available treatments for ALS primarily focus on providing symptomatic relief and have limited impact on disease progression. A high variability in disease phenotype and life expectancy is observed and believed to be related to the presence of genetic modifiers.
One of Maze's founders, Aaron Gitler, identified a potent genetic modifier, ATXN2, whose inhibition has been shown to limit the toxicity of a certain protein, TDP-43, which is involved in pathologic aggregates seen in up to 97% of all ALS cases. Maze is translating these important insights by developing a novel microRNA gene therapy that targets ATXN2 and has used the proprietary application of its functional genomics tools to optimize its properties. Maze plans to name the development candidate in early 2022.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory: Lab Event Encourages Growth of Women in Data Science

The U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory issued the following news release:
Coinciding with International Women's Day on March 8, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's 4th Women in Data Science (WiDS) regional event brought women together to discuss successes, opportunities and challenges of being female in a mostly male field.
The Lab's first-ever virtual WiDS gathering attracted dozens of LLNL data scientists as well as some from outside the Lab, and featured speakers, a career panel and breakout sessions where women could network and discuss mentoring and career advancement.
"If some of you have experienced being literally the only woman at the table, or the only woman on a panel, I'm sure you can agree it's quite special to have an event centered on women in data science," LLNL Bioinformatics Group Leader and WiDS Livermore Ambassador Marisa Torres told attendees. "We're here to celebrate a lot of accomplishments."
Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) Deputy Division Leader Ana Kupresanin addressed morning attendees, discussing her path from a high school student in her home country of Croatia to becoming a statistician at LLNL, where she focuses on the uncertainty quantification of predictive models for the weapons program. Advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are helping accelerate scientific discovery, and CASC researchers work with the scientific community to build a firm theoretical foundation for ML and AI, with a particular emphasis on the Lab's broad mission space, she said.
"The nature of scientific computing is changing with the rapid rise of data science and fundamental physical limitations imposing challenges on computer hardware," Kupresanin said. "This not only presents new challenges, but offers opportunities in creating new algorithms and developing improved workflows that will more tightly couple experiment, simulation and theory."
Kupresanin, who is heavily involved with academia through her role with the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program, and with the University of California through her work as a Data Science Institute (DSI) council member, said the broader adoption of ML is creating greater demand for statisticians and data scientists, positions that could be filled by women currently seeking their degrees.
"These students are bold, they're not afraid to ask questions and try new methods, and they think outside the box," Kupresanin said. "This new generation is really excited about what they can do to change the world and they have enormous energy."
For the event's career panel, LLNL data scientists Brenda Ng, Mary Silva, Juanita Ordonez and Hiranmayi Ranganathan discussed balancing work and family obligations, imposter syndrome, preventing burnout and other challenges unique to women in data science, a field in which women make up only about 15 percent of the workforce.
"I feel I have to prove I'm five times better to get a seat at the table," said Ng, who said she faced biases despite her Ivy League background. "I always have to be my own advocate. No matter how hard you work you still have to put yourself out there. The reality is people in power will always want to promote people who are like them and we need to change that."
Ng acknowledged the recent hiring of LLNL's first woman director, Kim Budil, as a step in the right direction and encouraged attendees to not be afraid to pursue their dreams.
"I'm a really competitive person, so if some boy tells me he can do something better, I'll be like, 'I'll show you I can do it better than you and reduce you to tears,' " Ng said laughing. "With all the opportunities in data science, don't ever think about it as a boy's thing. If you think it, you're already putting yourself at a disadvantage. Always think you are super and be that super person you want to be."
Ranganathan, who had a baby during the COVID-19 pandemic and has managed her work responsibilities while also guiding her 4-year-old through online school, talked about the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
"My advice is to enjoy what you do," Ranganathan said. "As long as you find something to do that you enjoy, you'll do it well. Set small goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. When you reward yourself, you feel like you've accomplished something, and it encourages you and makes you want to get up and do the same thing over again the next day. And it's OK if you don't finish something in the stipulated time as long as you're at it and you know you've given your best."
LLNL data scientist Amar Saini, a former DSI summer intern from the University of California, Merced, moderated the panel. Panelists stressed the importance of finding women mentors, attending conferences, getting the right training and taking advantage of educational and internship opportunities such as those offered through the Lab's DSI.
"People see data science as a male-dominated field. That might have been true 20 years ago, but there's a lot more women working in it now, especially at the Lab," said LLNL data scientist Mary Silva, who recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz and works on spatial modeling and active learning development for two Lab projects related to COVID-19. "I think that misconception is something that scares a lot of (women) off. It can definitely be intimidating when your computer science classes are mostly men. But as I got more involved, I saw a lot of women doing really great things and it really inspired me."
A first-generation college student, Ordonez said she wasn't exposed to computer science until her mid-20s. A volunteer with the Girls Who Code program, Ordonez said the key to bringing more women (and men) into computer science is cultivating interest in the subject in middle school and high school.
"If I had been introduced to it in high school, I would've been really into it and I feel like I would've been farther in life," Ordonez said. "When I was at my internship and university, I noticed a lot of people that were into computer science already had parents who came from that career path. And when you see the first-generation students, they're lost because they don't know what to do. Introducing computer science very early on to both guys and girls will always be positive because you're introducing more ideas and perspectives. And everyone is welcome, not just girls."
Nisha Mulakken, a bioinformaticist working on the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array, served as the event's closing speaker. Mulakken, who is studying the impact of microbiomes on COVID-19 severity among other pursuits, shared tips for mentoring young women and urged viewers to seek guidance through DSI and the Lab's Data Science Summer Institute, which she co-directs.
"I would not be where I am without the internships that inspired me to follow this research path, not to mention the mentors who encouraged me along the way," Mulakken said. I'm really excited to be able to bring up the next generation of Lab data scientists. It's important to me to give back."
Organized by LLNL ambassadors, the Livermore WiDS event also featured a speed mentoring session moderated by LLNL computer scientist Stephanie Brink, a Howspace collaborative platform for chatting, virtual breakout rooms and a trivia game. Throughout the day, attendees also tuned into the worldwide livestream of talks and panels hosted by Stanford University.
Torres led the WiDS Livermore organizing committee, which also included Silva, Brink, Saini, Cindy Gonzales, Jennifer Bellig and Holly Auten.
Livermore was one of more than 200 WiDS events held in more than 60 countries in conjunction with the conference, the first-ever virtual WiDS spanning an entire 24 hours. The conference featured panels and talks by women data scientists from all over the world, including keynote addresses by UC Berkeley professor Shafi Goldwasser on the impact of cryptography on machine learning research and by Google principal scientist Fernanda Viegas on data visualization in science and art.

 Oracle today announced that Prosper Digital Therapeutics (ProsperDTX), a company that pairs patient medical data with causal machine learning to develop personalized treatment plans, has selectedOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Scienceto host its machine learning platform. ProsperDTX usesOracle Autonomous Data WarehouseandOCI Object Storageto ingest and store data from multiple sources, including medical records systems and wearables, in real-time for faster predictive modeling. With the unprecedented healthcare demands brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, predictive data science modeling is critical to driving patient-centered solutions.
"We selected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure because of its unique ability to quickly process vast amounts of data and enable a faster time to market for our healthcare solutions. We've already realized a 25 percent cost saving," said Robert Goldberg, CEO, Prosper Digital Therapeutics. "With a proven record of offering cloud solutions and expertise for the healthcare industry, Oracle is an instrumental partner to our company's future growth."
"We are excited to work with ProsperDTX to help improve their ability to turn the power of machine learning into better patient care," said Greg Pavlik, senior vice president, data and AI, Oracle Cloud. "With our expertise in the healthcare field and our robust ecosystem of healthcare customers, we look forward to partnering with ProsperDTX to accelerate its network expansion as the company grows into its next stage of development."
ProsperDTX's machine learning technology develops causal models for each individual, thereby developing a care plan that can avoid complications related to cancer. By asking 'what if' questions, such as 'would I still get lung cancer if I continue smoking or stop smoking?' ProsperDTX can establish causal relationships and model what would happen in the future in the absence of a treatment or a delay of treatment in ways that optimize outcomes. This can't be achieved with traditional machine learning which has thus far focused on retrospective, or backward-looking research. What likely caused this person's heart attack? Was it smoking, bad diet, lack of exercise, all of the above? ProsperDTX machine learning focuses on future outcomes, not the past causes of current conditions.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science helps data scientists rapidly build, train, deploy and manage machine learning models. Unlike other data science products that focus on individual data scientists, OCI Data Science helps improve the effectiveness of data science teams with capabilities like shared projects, model catalogs, team security policies, reproducibility and auditability. Using OCI Data Science, ProsperDTX is designed to facilitate compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for every stage of themachine learning lifecycle, from data ingestion to model deployment.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Can Boost Clean Energy Technologies, Energy Efficiency, and Climate Modeling
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced up to $34.5 million to harness cutting-edge research tools for new scientific discoveries, including clean energy and climate solutions. Two new funding opportunities will support researchers using data science and computation-based methods-including artificial intelligence and machine learning-to tackle basic science challenges, advance clean energy technologies, improve energy efficiency, and predict extreme weather and climate patterns.
Today we have computers and tools that can collect, crunch, and decode mind-blowing amounts of data-and when you pair that power with America's brilliant scientists, there is no problem we can't solve, said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. By aiming these resources square at our toughest challenges, including the climate crisis, we can discover the most effective solutions and deploy them faster for the American people.
In recent years, the explosion of accessible data and new computation-based analysis tools has helped scientists and researchers better understand and predict the nature of complex scientific processes. These tools have been used to figure out how solar cells can be designed to absorb light more efficiently, or how captured carbon dioxide can be converted in usable products instead of re-entering the atmosphere.
Artificial intelligence is already shaping our lives in countless ways, and the biggest upsides to AI remain in the future. That's why we must continue to invest in this generation-defining technology in ways that can help us combat the biggest issues of our day, like the climate crisis. The Department of Energy has a long history of funding foundational research, and I'm proud it is taking a major lead in providing federal funding for AI R&D. This funding will galvanize groundbreaking discoveries to improve lives and ensure our country remains a global leader in technology and science, said Representative Anna Eshoo.
DOE's Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES) will award up to $21 million over three years for research applying data science methods, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, to basic chemical and materials science challenges-such as the discovery and development of new materials and chemical processes to harvest, store, and use energy more efficiently, while limiting emissions. For more information, visit the BES funding opportunity page.
DOE's Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) will award an additional $13.5 million over three years for efforts to use computer-based models and networking infrastructure to help research facilities across the nation collaborate and accelerate scientific discovery. Potential applications include tools for improving energy usage, and climate and weather forecasting. For more information, visit the ASCR funding opportunities page.
A total of up to $11.5 million will be provided for the two efforts in the current fiscal year, with outyear funding contingent on Congressional appropriations.

LIVERMORE, Calif., March 17 -- The U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory issued the following press release:
Coinciding with International Women's Day on March 8, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (https://www.llnl.gov/) 4th Women in Data Science (WiDS) regional event brought women together to discuss successes, opportunities and challenges of being female in a mostly male field.
The Lab's first-ever virtual WiDS gathering attracted dozens of LLNL data scientists as well as some from outside the Lab, and featured speakers, a career panel and breakout sessions where women could network and discuss mentoring and career advancement.
"If some of you have experienced being literally the only woman at the table, or the only woman on a panel, I'm sure you can agree it's quite special to have an event centered on women in data science," LLNL Bioinformatics Group Leader and WiDS Livermore Ambassador Marisa Torres told attendees. "We're here to celebrate a lot of accomplishments."
Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) Deputy Division Leader Ana Kupresanin addressed morning attendees, discussing her path from a high school student in her home country of Croatia to becoming a statistician at LLNL, where she focuses on the uncertainty quantification of predictive models for the weapons program. Advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are helping accelerate scientific discovery, and CASC researchers work with the scientific community to build a firm theoretical foundation for ML and AI, with a particular emphasis on the Lab's broad mission space, she said.
"The nature of scientific computing is changing with the rapid rise of data science and fundamental physical limitations imposing challenges on computer hardware," Kupresanin said. "This not only presents new challenges, but offers opportunities in creating new algorithms and developing improved workflows that will more tightly couple experiment, simulation and theory."
Kupresanin, who is heavily involved with academia through her role with the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program, and with the University of California through her work as a Data Science Institute (DSI) council member, said the broader adoption of ML is creating greater demand for statisticians and data scientists, positions that could be filled by women currently seeking their degrees.
"These students are bold, they're not afraid to ask questions and try new methods, and they think outside the box," Kupresanin said. "This new generation is really excited about what they can do to change the world and they have enormous energy."
For the event's career panel, LLNL data scientists Brenda Ng, Mary Silva, Juanita Ordonez and Hiranmayi Ranganathan discussed balancing work and family obligations, imposter syndrome, preventing burnout and other challenges unique to women in data science, a field in which women make up only about 15 percent of the workforce.
"I feel I have to prove I'm five times better to get a seat at the table," said Ng, who said she faced biases despite her Ivy League background. "I always have to be my own advocate. No matter how hard you work you still have to put yourself out there. The reality is people in power will always want to promote people who are like them and we need to change that."
Ng acknowledged the recent hiring of LLNL's first woman director, Kim Budil, as a step in the right direction and encouraged attendees to not be afraid to pursue their dreams.
"I'm a really competitive person, so if some boy tells me he can do something better, I'll be like, 'I'll show you I can do it better than you and reduce you to tears,' " Ng said laughing. "With all the opportunities in data science, don't ever think about it as a boy's thing. If you think it, you're already putting yourself at a disadvantage. Always think you are super and be that super person you want to be."
Ranganathan, who had a baby during the COVID-19 pandemic and has managed her work responsibilities while also guiding her 4-year-old through online school, talked about the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
"My advice is to enjoy what you do," Ranganathan said. "As long as you find something to do that you enjoy, you'll do it well. Set small goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. When you reward yourself, you feel like you've accomplished something, and it encourages you and makes you want to get up and do the same thing over again the next day. And it's OK if you don't finish something in the stipulated time as long as you're at it and you know you've given your best."
LLNL data scientist Amar Saini, a former DSI summer intern from the University of California, Merced, moderated the panel. Panelists stressed the importance of finding women mentors, attending conferences, getting the right training and taking advantage of educational and internship opportunities such as those offered through the Lab's DSI.
"People see data science as a male-dominated field. That might have been true 20 years ago, but there's a lot more women working in it now, especially at the Lab," said LLNL data scientist Mary Silva, who recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz and works on spatial modeling and active learning development for two Lab projects related to COVID-19. "I think that misconception is something that scares a lot of (women) off. It can definitely be intimidating when your computer science classes are mostly men. But as I got more involved, I saw a lot of women doing really great things and it really inspired me."
A first-generation college student, Ordonez said she wasn't exposed to computer science until her mid-20s. A volunteer with the Girls Who Code program, Ordonez said the key to bringing more women (and men) into computer science is cultivating interest in the subject in middle school and high school.
"If I had been introduced to it in high school, I would've been really into it and I feel like I would've been farther in life," Ordonez said. "When I was at my internship and university, I noticed a lot of people that were into computer science already had parents who came from that career path. And when you see the first-generation students, they're lost because they don't know what to do. Introducing computer science very early on to both guys and girls will always be positive because you're introducing more ideas and perspectives. And everyone is welcome, not just girls."
Nisha Mulakken, a bioinformaticist working on the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array, served as the event's closing speaker. Mulakken, who is studying the impact of microbiomes on COVID-19 severity among other pursuits, shared tips for mentoring young women and urged viewers to seek guidance through DSI and the Lab's Data Science Summer Institute, which she co-directs.
"I would not be where I am without the internships that inspired me to follow this research path, not to mention the mentors who encouraged me along the way," Mulakken said. I'm really excited to be able to bring up the next generation of Lab data scientists. It's important to me to give back."
Organized by LLNL ambassadors, the Livermore WiDS event also featured a speed mentoring session moderated by LLNL computer scientist Stephanie Brink, a Howspace collaborative platform for chatting, virtual breakout rooms and a trivia game. Throughout the day, attendees also tuned into the worldwide livestream of talks and panels hosted by Stanford University.
Torres led the WiDS Livermore organizing committee, which also included Silva, Brink, Saini, Cindy Gonzales, Jennifer Bellig and Holly Auten.
Livermore was one of more than 200 WiDS events held in more than 60 countries in conjunction with the conference, the first-ever virtual WiDS spanning an entire 24 hours. The conference featured panels and talks by women data scientists from all over the world, including keynote addresses by UC Berkeley professor Shafi Goldwasser on the impact of cryptography on machine learning research and by Google principal scientist Fernanda Viegas on data visualization in science and art.

New York: Association for Computing Machinery has issued the following press release:
Recognizing the explosive growth of data science as a field, as well as the demand for data science training at the undergraduate level, a Data Science Task Force convened by the Association for Computing Machinery’s Education Board recently released Computing Competencies for Undergraduate Data Science Curricula. The ACM report seeks to define what the computing/computational contributions are to this new field, as well as to provide guidance on computing-specific competencies in data science for departments offering such programs of study at the undergraduate level.
“This seemed like the perfect time for the computing community to define our field’s contributions to a well-rounded data science curriculum,” remarked Paul Leidig, Professor, Grand Valley State University and Co-chair, ACM Data Science Task Force. “Data science is an interdisciplinary endeavor between computer science, mathematics, statistics, and applied areas such as natural sciences. We hope our effort in outlining computing competencies for data science will encourage more collaboration within the distinct disciplines that make up this field. This is an important step in establishing universal guidelines for a field that is attracting a great deal of interest from undergraduates, but is also, in many ways, still misunderstood. ”
To gain a picture of the current landscape of undergraduate degrees in data science, the ACM Data Science Task Force sent a survey to undergraduate institutions across the county asking a series of questions about their programs. Of the 672 institutions who responded, 24.7% indicated that they offer a Data Science major, while 16% responded that they offer a minor.
The Task Force also surveyed industry leaders to see if they were specifically interested in hiring candidates with an undergraduate degree in Data Science. To the question “Do you look for job candidates (specifically new graduates of undergraduate programs) with a Data Science background?”, 48% of the 297 companies that responded said they do look for candidates with a Data Science background.
The interest in earning degrees in Data Science stems partially from the job prospects in the field, which includes both companies seeking formally trained data scientists, as well as a host of industries, including healthcare, natural sciences, finance, marketing, and businesses of all kinds, that are seeking employees with some data science skills.
“Until very recently, most people working in data science had earned traditional Computer Science Bachelor’s degrees and then earned graduate degrees in Data Science, or perhaps learned advanced data science techniques on the job,” added Leidig. “The trend of emphasizing experience as a ‘data scientist’ at earlier and earlier stages in one’s career is a recognition that students should have familiarity with the ways in which computer science, mathematics, statistics, and applied areas overlap. Learning data science holistically will certainly benefit young people who are entering a field that is constantly changing and growing. ”
The ACM report also includes a chapter on broadening participation in the field, which outlines opportunities to reverse imbalances of participation for women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities. Recognizing the impact of data science on all aspects of society, the report also includes a chapter on professionalism, including stressing that ethical issues are of vital importance for all involved in computing and information activities.
In their introduction to the report, the Task Force emphasized that data science is an inherently interdisciplinary field and noted that true interdisciplinary work is challenging. In welcoming collaborations with statisticians, mathematicians, and others in the data science environment, the Task Force wrote: “The difficulty…is to make the essential connections so that all the parts work together to support discovery and decision making in the domain. Cross references between courses, projects that call upon topics learned in other courses, and a comprehensive project to bring all the pieces together are essential to turn a mixed set of courses into a cohesive, interdisciplinary program. ”
